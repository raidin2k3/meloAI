21,"> For the first time, SpaceX not only launched its mammoth Starship, but also returned the booster to the launch site and to caught it with a pair of oversized ‚Äúchopsticks.‚Äù

> This test flight ‚Äî the fifth in the Starship development program ‚Äî took place Sunday morning at the company‚Äôs Starbase site in southeast Texas. The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship is at the centerpiece of SpaceX‚Äôs stated ambition to make life multi-planetary, but more immediately NASA‚Äôs ambitious Artemis campaign to return humans to the surface of the moon.

> SpaceX envisions rapid reuse of the entire Starship vehicle, which includes an upper stage (also called Starship) and a Super Heavy booster ‚Äî but that means proving out the capability to recover both stages and quickly refurbish them for future flights. 

> So it makes sense that the primary objectives for this fifth flight test were two-fold: attempting the first-ever ‚Äúcatch‚Äù of the Super Heavy booster at the launch site and an on-target Starship reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

> The latter goal had already been achieved: SpaceX nailed a controlled reentry and splashdown of the Starship upper stage during the last test mission in June. But the booster catch, as the company put it in a blog post, would be ‚Äúsingularly novel‚Äù in the history of rocketry.

> The closest analogue is the now-routine Falcon 9 booster landings on autonomous barges and terrestrial landing zones. In today‚Äôs launch, the booster slowed to a hover and gently positioned itself inside the zone of two ‚Äúchopstick‚Äù arms attached to the launch tower. Those arms then closed around the booster and hold it up after its engines stop firing. 

> You can see the catch at around 40 minutes into SpaceX‚Äôs video of the test. Following the booster detachment and catch, Starship continued to ascend into orbit before splashing in the Indian Ocean and exploding (SpaceX had not planned to recover the spacecraft).

> SpaceX noted in an update posted on its website that ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of criteria showing healthy systems across the vehicle and pad had to be met for the catch attempt to occur. This test also took place a little sooner than expected: the Federal Aviation Administration had previously said that it did not anticipate issuing a modified launch license for this test before late November. 

> That timeline gave much umbrage to SpaceX, leading the company to repeatedly call out what it characterized as the regulator‚Äôs inefficiency. But the FAA announced on Saturday that it had approved the launch.

> ‚ÄúThe FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight,‚Äù the regulator said in a statement. Notably, the authorization also includes approval for the next test flight, given that ‚Äúthe changes requested by SpaceX for Flight 6 are within the scope of what has been previously analyazed,‚Äù the FAA said.

> While awaiting this launch license, SpaceX engineers have stayed very busy: in recent months, they have conducted numerous tests on the launch tower, completely replaced the rocket‚Äôs entire thermal protection system with newer tiles and a backup ablative layer, and updated the ship‚Äôs software for reentry. This week, engineers completed propellant loading tests and testing of the launch pad‚Äôs water deluge system, which is meant to protect the pad from the powerful fire of the booster‚Äôs 33 Raptor engines.

> The company eventually plans on bringing the Starship upper stage back to the landing site too, though we‚Äôll have to wait to see that in future test launches. 

> ‚ÄúWith each flight building on the learnings from the last, testing improvements in hardware and operations across every facet of Starship, we‚Äôre on the verge of demonstrating techniques fundamental to Starship‚Äôs fully and rapidly reusable design,‚Äù the company says. ‚ÄúBy continuing to push our hardware in a flight environment, and doing so as safely and frequently as possible, we‚Äôll rapidly bring Starship online and revolutionize humanity‚Äôs ability to access space.‚Äù",SpaceX successfully catches returning Starship booster ,2024-10-13 23:32:24,2

116,"> For the first time, SpaceX not only launched its mammoth Starship, but also returned the booster to the launch site and to caught it with a pair of oversized ‚Äúchopsticks.‚Äù

> This test flight ‚Äî the fifth in the Starship development program ‚Äî took place Sunday morning at the company‚Äôs Starbase site in southeast Texas. The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship is at the centerpiece of SpaceX‚Äôs stated ambition to make life multi-planetary, but more immediately NASA‚Äôs ambitious Artemis campaign to return humans to the surface of the moon.

> SpaceX envisions rapid reuse of the entire Starship vehicle, which includes an upper stage (also called Starship) and a Super Heavy booster ‚Äî but that means proving out the capability to recover both stages and quickly refurbish them for future flights. 

> So it makes sense that the primary objectives for this fifth flight test were two-fold: attempting the first-ever ‚Äúcatch‚Äù of the Super Heavy booster at the launch site and an on-target Starship reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

> The latter goal had already been achieved: SpaceX nailed a controlled reentry and splashdown of the Starship upper stage during the last test mission in June. But the booster catch, as the company put it in a blog post, would be ‚Äúsingularly novel‚Äù in the history of rocketry.

> The closest analogue is the now-routine Falcon 9 booster landings on autonomous barges and terrestrial landing zones. In today‚Äôs launch, the booster slowed to a hover and gently positioned itself inside the zone of two ‚Äúchopstick‚Äù arms attached to the launch tower. Those arms then closed around the booster and hold it up after its engines stop firing. 

> You can see the catch at around 40 minutes into SpaceX‚Äôs video of the test. Following the booster detachment and catch, Starship continued to ascend into orbit before splashing in the Indian Ocean and exploding (SpaceX had not planned to recover the spacecraft).

> SpaceX noted in an update posted on its website that ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of criteria showing healthy systems across the vehicle and pad had to be met for the catch attempt to occur. This test also took place a little sooner than expected: the Federal Aviation Administration had previously said that it did not anticipate issuing a modified launch license for this test before late November. 

> That timeline gave much umbrage to SpaceX, leading the company to repeatedly call out what it characterized as the regulator‚Äôs inefficiency. But the FAA announced on Saturday that it had approved the launch.

> ‚ÄúThe FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight,‚Äù the regulator said in a statement. Notably, the authorization also includes approval for the next test flight, given that ‚Äúthe changes requested by SpaceX for Flight 6 are within the scope of what has been previously analyazed,‚Äù the FAA said.

> While awaiting this launch license, SpaceX engineers have stayed very busy: in recent months, they have conducted numerous tests on the launch tower, completely replaced the rocket‚Äôs entire thermal protection system with newer tiles and a backup ablative layer, and updated the ship‚Äôs software for reentry. This week, engineers completed propellant loading tests and testing of the launch pad‚Äôs water deluge system, which is meant to protect the pad from the powerful fire of the booster‚Äôs 33 Raptor engines.

> The company eventually plans on bringing the Starship upper stage back to the landing site too, though we‚Äôll have to wait to see that in future test launches. 

> ‚ÄúWith each flight building on the learnings from the last, testing improvements in hardware and operations across every facet of Starship, we‚Äôre on the verge of demonstrating techniques fundamental to Starship‚Äôs fully and rapidly reusable design,‚Äù the company says. ‚ÄúBy continuing to push our hardware in a flight environment, and doing so as safely and frequently as possible, we‚Äôll rapidly bring Starship online and revolutionize humanity‚Äôs ability to access space.‚Äù",SpaceX successfully catches returning Starship booster ,2024-10-13 23:32:24,2

202,"From the article: Google wants to clarify some questions around the skip ad button that seemingly disappeared from YouTube last week. Google insists the button is still there, while YouTube focuses on a cleaner aesthetic.

It was only a few days ago that we first reported on user observations that YouTube was hiding the skip ad button. It had first been noticed by Reddit users who posted videos of a gray rectangle obscuring the button on desktop. Then one of our intrepid journalists found the skip ad button was replaced on the mobile app with a countdown timer.

YouTube Ads Communication Manager Oluwa Falodun reached out to us to clarify what we were seeing.

""On skippable ads, the button appears after 5 seconds into playback, as always,"" Falodun told us in an email. ""Viewers on the mobile and desktop experience may see the countdown timer now appear as a progress bar on the bottom of the screen.""

YouTube is focusing on a cleaner and more seamless viewing experience. The platform aims to minimize distractions and encourage users to ""engage more deeply with the ad creative,"" Falodun added.","Google says the YouTube skip ad button isn't gone, it's just different",2024-10-11 11:54:35,2

The group‚Äôs account on X also shows that it was created by someone in Staraya, a town in Novgorod Oblast, Russia. The account‚Äôs initial language was also set to Russian.

The researchers added that analysis of timestamps and activity patterns showed possible evidence that the actors within the group are operating in a timezone ‚Äúclose to Moscow Standard Time (MSK, UTC+3) or other Middle Eastern or Eastern European time zones (UTC+2 to UTC+4).‚Äù¬†

385,"> For the first time, SpaceX not only launched its mammoth Starship, but also returned the booster to the launch site and to caught it with a pair of oversized ‚Äúchopsticks.‚Äù

> This test flight ‚Äî the fifth in the Starship development program ‚Äî took place Sunday morning at the company‚Äôs Starbase site in southeast Texas. The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship is at the centerpiece of SpaceX‚Äôs stated ambition to make life multi-planetary, but more immediately NASA‚Äôs ambitious Artemis campaign to return humans to the surface of the moon.

> SpaceX envisions rapid reuse of the entire Starship vehicle, which includes an upper stage (also called Starship) and a Super Heavy booster ‚Äî but that means proving out the capability to recover both stages and quickly refurbish them for future flights. 

> So it makes sense that the primary objectives for this fifth flight test were two-fold: attempting the first-ever ‚Äúcatch‚Äù of the Super Heavy booster at the launch site and an on-target Starship reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

> The latter goal had already been achieved: SpaceX nailed a controlled reentry and splashdown of the Starship upper stage during the last test mission in June. But the booster catch, as the company put it in a blog post, would be ‚Äúsingularly novel‚Äù in the history of rocketry.

> The closest analogue is the now-routine Falcon 9 booster landings on autonomous barges and terrestrial landing zones. In today‚Äôs launch, the booster slowed to a hover and gently positioned itself inside the zone of two ‚Äúchopstick‚Äù arms attached to the launch tower. Those arms then closed around the booster and hold it up after its engines stop firing. 

> You can see the catch at around 40 minutes into SpaceX‚Äôs video of the test. Following the booster detachment and catch, Starship continued to ascend into orbit before splashing in the Indian Ocean and exploding (SpaceX had not planned to recover the spacecraft).

> SpaceX noted in an update posted on its website that ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of criteria showing healthy systems across the vehicle and pad had to be met for the catch attempt to occur. This test also took place a little sooner than expected: the Federal Aviation Administration had previously said that it did not anticipate issuing a modified launch license for this test before late November. 

> That timeline gave much umbrage to SpaceX, leading the company to repeatedly call out what it characterized as the regulator‚Äôs inefficiency. But the FAA announced on Saturday that it had approved the launch.

> ‚ÄúThe FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight,‚Äù the regulator said in a statement. Notably, the authorization also includes approval for the next test flight, given that ‚Äúthe changes requested by SpaceX for Flight 6 are within the scope of what has been previously analyazed,‚Äù the FAA said.

> While awaiting this launch license, SpaceX engineers have stayed very busy: in recent months, they have conducted numerous tests on the launch tower, completely replaced the rocket‚Äôs entire thermal protection system with newer tiles and a backup ablative layer, and updated the ship‚Äôs software for reentry. This week, engineers completed propellant loading tests and testing of the launch pad‚Äôs water deluge system, which is meant to protect the pad from the powerful fire of the booster‚Äôs 33 Raptor engines.

> The company eventually plans on bringing the Starship upper stage back to the landing site too, though we‚Äôll have to wait to see that in future test launches.

‚ÄúIn 2022, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that **TikTok‚Äôs human moderators around the world are only paid the equivalent of about $1.80 an hour or $10 a day**‚Äîand are regularly required to review videos containing ‚Äúmurder, suicide, pedophili[a], pornographic content, accidents, [or] cannibalism.‚Äù Many of the workers live in developing countries like Mexico, Malaysia, or Colombia.

TikTok moderators told the outlet that any psychological support is just for show, and that moderators are heavily surveilled. If they don‚Äôt review a minimum number of videos a month, they may lose up to a quarter of their salary as deducted bonus pay. One moderator explained that they have to review 900 videos a day, and **only watching 700 videos a day is considered ‚Äúwork avoidance.**‚Äù

620,"Nuclear, Bacterial, Chemical (NBC) warfare is the testing ground for this question. I think it's here to stay.

We have managed to mostly draw a line at NBC deployment.  Although all our military equipment must pass NBC requirements we don't deploy NBC weapons. 

It was about the humanity of war. It's one thing to kill/wound your enemy quickly but to turn it into a lingering death that takes days/weeks to die is not ""good form"" when it comes to killing.

I do not think your drone killbots will ever go away. They are more efficient. They are more effective. They can better avoid collateral damage than a dumb shell fired from a 155.

This is an evolutionary change in warfare.  Just how fundamental it is I'm not sure. I do think it's on par with the rifled barrel or automatic fire weapons (Maxim machine gun, Tommy gun).  It will get really interesting as they start creating purpose built drones instead of modifying hobby drones.

This revolutionizes the concept of the second amendment. You can keep your guns and we will just drone your ass from 17 miles away while sipping a latte in a cubicle.  And how to keep the killbots from becoming assassins will be just as problematic.  They can be very small to kill one person. 

I expect to see something like smart RPGs that refine their targeting as they fly.  If you only want to kill one person then this becomes an RPG like device but the size of a bic pen.  Homing in on a painted target would be even easier for assassinations.

You want to go all digital, that's fine. I can relate to the desire to not have to get off your fat ass to swap discs when you want to play a different game. As long as you know what you're getting into and are fine with it, knock yourself out. Just remember, however, that especially with console games, there's likely a finite lifespan for any digital game. Look at all the Nintendo DS, Wii and Wii U games that now only exist on isolated units. I may have to get off my fat ass and manually swap out discs, but with physical media, so long as I have a working console, and there's single player content, I can play it. It might be a buggy gold release version, but that's better than not being able to play it at all. PC games tend to last a bit longer, and you might be able to find pirated copies long after a game has been delisted, but often times changes in the underlying OS will spell doom for older games. 

Personally, I won't spend more than maybe $20 on Steam for any given game. That's roughly how much I'm willing to risk losing if anything happens that keeps me from ever playing the game. Be it life happening and I suddenly have no free time, my computer blows up and I can't afford to replace it, I want to finish up some other game first and then forget about it, maybe I hit some game breaking bug after the return window lapses, or any number of other possibilities. $20 is generally what I'm willing to risk.

Just because it's a digital/licensing format doesn't mean it should just be immediately justifiable to pirate the software.

I don't see Steam as some kind of evil corporation trying to milk me out of money, so I don't purposefully go out of my way to circumvent purchasing from them.

And you never had any kind of legal right to pirate stuff - you may have some limited right to make personal use copies and backups of purchased media, depending on jurisdiction, but it always had to stem directly from your own legitimate copy.

886,"There's still some confusion here.

Consider the conventional context of ""owning"" a game title by purchasing a cartridge / CD-ROM / etc. Copyright law makes a distinction about ownership of the data and content vs. ownership of the physical article. For instance, you can't legally transfer copies to other people, either in physical or digital form. But you do *own* the one copy that you purchased, which gives you certain rights that the content owners can't restrict. You can install it and run it indefinitely; you can resell it; you can create copies for fair use purposes, including making archival copies for yourself; and you can even break copyright enforcement mechanisms for the purpose of compatibility (e.g., maintaining the ability to run it on your devices). That's what it means to own a copy of a copyrighted work: you hold a certain bundle of rights to the possession and use of its content, and the copyright holder cannot legally prohibit you from using those rights.

In the context of Steam, ""ownership"" is already a little dodgy, since resale is 100% prohibited. But people still have certain expectations - like:

* If I buy a title once, I can download, install and run it on all of my own devices, forever, without ever having to pay for it again.

* If I buy a title once through Steam, the content owner can never take back those rights. They can't remove the title from my library, and they can't  force my devices to uninstall it or refuse to run it.

Again, this gets dodgy when the title requires third-party servers to run, especially when those third-party servers are required to run a purely local, single-player game. But aside from those considerations, the expectations of ownership were pretty clear.

The point of this article is that Valve appears to be retreating to an *even further restricted* basis, lacking the expectations above. By shifting to a purely license-based approach, Valve is legally granting third parties the complete right to control - including alter - how your devices run the software and whether the software even appears in your library. The content owners control everything relating to the software, can change it on a whim, and can even disrupt your devices to achieve their goals. It's a huge step backwards for digital rights.

Based on that context, your summary is still kind of off. It suggests that ""licensing"" is somehow better than ""ownership,"" when in fact it's the opposite: the licenses offered by third parties through Valve grant fewer and less reliable rights than should attach to the purchase (i.e., ownership) of a copyrighted title.","Steam now tells gamers up front that they're buying a license, not a game | The company appears to be getting ahead of a California law going into force next year.",2024-10-11 11:06:24,2

962,"From the article: Google wants to clarify some questions around the skip ad button that seemingly disappeared from YouTube last week. Google insists the button is still there, while YouTube focuses on a cleaner aesthetic.

It was only a few days ago that we first reported on user observations that YouTube was hiding the skip ad button. It had first been noticed by Reddit users who posted videos of a gray rectangle obscuring the button on desktop. Then one of our intrepid journalists found the skip ad button was replaced on the mobile app with a countdown timer.

YouTube Ads Communication Manager Oluwa Falodun reached out to us to clarify what we were seeing.

""On skippable ads, the button appears after 5 seconds into playback, as always,"" Falodun told us in an email. ""Viewers on the mobile and desktop experience may see the countdown timer now appear as a progress bar on the bottom of the screen.""

YouTube is focusing on a cleaner and more seamless viewing experience. The platform aims to minimize distractions and encourage users to ""engage more deeply with the ad creative,"" Falodun added.","Google says the YouTube skip ad button isn't gone, it's just different",2024-10-11 11:54:35,2

‚ÄúThis group claims to be pro palestinian and it‚Äôs entirely based on Russia.

https://therecord.media/middle-east-financial-institution-6-day-ddos-attack

SN_BLACKMETA has operated its Telegram channel since November 2023, boasting of DDoS incidents and cyberattacks on infrastructure in Israel, the Palestinian Territories and elsewhere. While all of the group‚Äôs messages focus on the Palestinian Territories and perceived opponents to Palestine, many of its posts are written in Russian.¬†

The group‚Äôs account on X also shows that it was created by someone in Staraya, a town in Novgorod Oblast, Russia. The account‚Äôs initial language was also set to Russian.

The researchers added that analysis of timestamps and activity patterns showed possible evidence that the actors within the group are operating in a timezone ‚Äúclose to Moscow Standard Time (MSK, UTC+3) or other Middle Eastern or Eastern European time zones (UTC+2 to UTC+4).‚Äù¬†

Attacks include pro palestine sites and groups, so take that ‚Äúpro palestine‚Äù with a grain of salt.‚Äù
