First, yes, please click links.  Now with that out of the way.  I thought your argument is that a new EV platform will have more recalls than an old one.  So, since we can't compare an old Cybertruck, we look at the Model 3.  And now you want to change how recalls are counted.  What happened to not having recalls because they had things figured out?  Did they forget how to do airbags and a hood latch because it is an EV?



>Ok.. you're still wrong though, it's not a brand new platform for this vehicle as you claimed, it's actually had a number of release models across multiple manufacturers over the years. 

It had one release model, the bZ4X.  And the bZ4X didn't ship until the middle of 2022, only 18 months before the Lexus.  Since we can't look at the Cybertruck 18 months later, how about we look at the Model 3 18 months after the first one?

Model 3 first delivered mid 2017.  So 18 months later would be the 2019, and we find 20 recalls.  https://www.cars.com/research/tesla-model_3-2019/recalls/

>It's not surprising you are aware of things like this though because it's only mainstream news when things happen to Tesla.

I assume you meant to imply that I was unaware of this.  But, I do recall it, and I even followed up on it to find the root cause and the fix.  At the time I thought, you have been putting wheels on cars for ages, how do you mess that up.

____
Back on topic.

My point is that even their older Model 3 has more recalls than a new Lexus line.  So even if you call the Lexus a 18 month old line, it still compares much better than the 18 month old Tesla model 3.  We will have to wait for the next Cybertruck, to see if they have less issues.

So an EV doesn't have to have more recalls than other cars.

Lastly, it is great that Tesla can fix many recalls OTA.  I still prefer a car without recalls in the first place.  So while the hood latch was easily fixed in July this year, the problem had been around since the 2020 models.",Cybertruck's Many Recalls Make It Worse Than 91 Percent of All 2024 Vehicles,2024-11-25 13:06:48,2

Sure. Adding some context, this was Tesla's first mass manufactured vehicle, not only was it a new platform and a new model, but a company new to manufacturing cars at this scale. They were essentially a boutique car oem before this. I own one of them and literally never had to take the care in for a recall, all updates and the one in person they drove to me. Excellent service. NHTSA is much more inclined to issue recalls for Tesla knowing it's something they can easily fixed without disruption to anyone over the air while they're sleeping.

I am confused.  Are you saying most car buyers don't care about reliability, and issues?

And what are you going on about one car.  The Cybertruck is one car.  You implied that a new EV will have more issues.  And I replied that the new Lexus did not have issues.

I am really not following what you are saying now.

>So why not look at the bz4x then? 

Ok, 2023 had two.  BTW, one simply needed a new label applied.  2024, had the same label recall that simply needed a new label.  Seems miles better than the model 3, or the Cybertruck.

>This was Tesla's first mass manufactured vehicle, not only was it a new platform and a new model, but a company new to manufacturing cars at this scale. They were essentially a boutique car oem before this.

So, do you admit they have had more issues?  Because now you are just giving excesses.

>That said, I'm not sure what you are even trying to argue at this point? I thought we were talking about the cyber truck what a massive goal post shift to the model 3..

This is because you kept moving goal posts...

I started with the Lexus, but you seem to think it is an old model, because of e-TNGA, which I disagree with this point.  So, I played your game and called it a 18 month old.  Since the Cybertruck is not an 18 month old, it could not be compared.  So I choose their most popular model, and choose the most recent model year to give it the best advantage.  Feel free to contact me when the 18 month old Cybertruck comes out.

""My point is that even their older Model 3 has more recalls than a new Lexus line. So even if you call the Lexus a 18 month old line, it still compares much better than the 18 month old Tesla model 3. We will have to wait for the next Cybertruck, to see if they have less issues.

Do explain how caring about ""reliability and issues"" when purchasing a car means looking at a single one off recall for a single car out millions sold in a year having a single manufacturer defect? You have to know how ridiculous this sounds.

>>Ok, 2023 had two. BTW, one simply needed a new label applied. 


Talking out of two sides of your mouth here as you hand waived away bz4x recalls but can't apply the same logic to yourself.

They do? Where do you think I've said otherwise? You moved the goal post and didn't realize I wasn't there. Not biting. 


> You implied that a new EV will have more issues. And I replied that the new Lexus did not have issues.

New EV on a new platform yeah they tend to have more than your average car that been on a mature platform.

140,"> Do explain how caring about ""reliability and issues"" when purchasing a car means looking at a single one off recall for a single car out millions sold in a year having a single manufacturer defect? You have to know how ridiculous this sounds.

What do you mean by a single car, the Cybertruck, model 3, RZ-450e, are not single cars but are model lines?  And I don't see the problem with looking at and comparing recalls for model lines, as well as manufacturers.

Also, I would look at the recall issues, how long the issue existed, and what the fix is.  So I would not just ignore the ones fixed by an OTA update.  Other cars have OTA updates other than Tesla, so I would not ignore those either.

As the original post article points out, the Cybertruck has had many recalls.

If you don't care at all about recalls fixed by an OTA update, that is fine.  That is your choice.  I do look at them.

>Talking out of two sides of your mouth here as you hand waived away bz4x recalls but can't apply the same logic to yourself. 

Please don't straw man.  I didn't say there were zero.  I pointed out the label, because you don't count OTA updates, and this seemed similar (not the same).

>Do you know what moving the goal post means? I've been referring to to a new EV model on a new vehicle platform since the start. Maybe go reread my first comment, might surprise you.

Yes, I know, and I am aware of your first comment.  The goal post moving is when I say the RZ-450e is new, and then you try to say the platform is a decade old.  Then, when I point out it was only 18 month old even if say the bz4x was first, which I don't, you seem to believe that isn't new I guess.  So I use the bz4x, itself, which had fewer recalls than the cybertruck as an example.  I have no clue how the goalposts have moved that the bz4x doesn't qualify.  Don't really care at this point.

>I said a new EV on a new vehicle platform, **not all evs have more recalls**. 

So, do we agree that not all EVs have more recalls?  Do we agree that not all new EVs on new platforms, i.e. the bz4x, have more recalls?

>That said I'd be curious to find out if all evs do, do you have some kind of empirical data or just a random Tesla and random different EV with not that many somehow through mental gymnastics proves **EVs don't have more recalls**?

The argument seems to insinuate, in this case, that jailbreaks are inherent features of software‚Äîas though jailbreaks are one of the ‚Äúlaws of robotics.‚Äù That‚Äôs just not true though.

It's one thing to tell Alexa or Siri to set a timer or schedule something on a calendar, it's another for it to understand what you're saying as a human does.


Most importantly, the cost of running data centers so a million people can tell Alexa to set a 15 minute timer for their cookies just doesn't make any sense. Where's the profit?


This is why very specifically trained AIs are the path forward. Take a cancer scan; typically you might have a doctor and a radiologist review scans. But if you train an AI you could also have it review the scans and report anything it finds with various confidence levels. The AI might be great at identifying specific cancers, but it sucks at any other incidental findings that a human might notice. The more you try to generalize the AI the less effective it becomes as a tool because the increased cost to train and run it.

570,">  like the zoning commission and patent office? They‚Äôre governing who can use what website, that is a regulatory function

Do you read your own posts?

What do you think a zoning commission does? It tells you where you can build things - like don‚Äôt put that dispensary right next to the school. The only way ***you*** bringing this into the comparison makes sense is if you‚Äôre hoping the government does the same, but constructing what you can do on our website instead of real estate.

Also, what do you think patent office does? Big hint ‚Äì nothing compared to what a domain registrar does. It‚Äôs a terrible analogy. 

A patent office exists because you can‚Äôt build something that I invented. There can‚Äôt be a competitive market for idea registration, because there is a legal enforcement mechanism so closely linked to it, and it needs a single, independent version of the truth.

A registrar does not do anything similar to a patent office. It doesn‚Äôt review claims, sort out precedent, assess things as overly broad or vague. The only thing that it has in common is a catalog structure. You know what else has catalogs of people and things they claim to have done? Social media ‚Äì Facebook, Instagram, Reddit. Every every single one has a person and something they allegedly did‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt need to be government either. 

I‚Äôm all for the government having a patent office - and an EPA, an FTC and even an IRS. It is absolutely vital to the economy if those things have one set of rules and standards, administered by a neutral body. 

But if you don‚Äôt need the government to be the only source of airbags or eyeglasses or accounting services, then you don‚Äôt need the government to be the only provider of name registration.",Elizabeth Warren calls for crackdown on Internet ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù you‚Äôve never heard of.

And just like a zoning commission, you need to register what you‚Äôre building so your new site is accurately mapped to the assigned address.

613,"> Security researchers have disrupted a major malicious botnet, and thus also hurt the proxy service it powered.

> Cybersecurity researchers from Lumen‚Äôs Black Lotus have released a new report saying they blocked all traffic across their global network that went to, or from, the dedicated infrastructure associated with the ‚Äòngioweb‚Äô botnet.

> The Ngioweb botnet, first spotted in mid-2023, operated more than 35,000 bots (compromised endpoints, basically) every day. The bots were located in 180 countries and were used, first and foremost, to power the NSOCKS proxy service. This ‚Äúnotorious criminal proxy service‚Äù, as Black Lotus describes it, is linked to the threat actor known as Muddled Libra. There are also indications that the proxy was used by state-sponsored threat actors such as APT28 (aka FancyBear, a known Russian threat actor).

> ‚ÄúAt least 80% of NSOCKS bots in our telemetry originate from the ngioweb botnet, mainly utilizing small office/home office (SOHO) routers and IoT devices. Two-thirds of these proxies are based in the U.S.,‚Äù the researchers said.

> A proxy service allows threat actors to run different malicious campaigns, while hiding their true identity and location, by using a ‚Äúproxy‚Äù - or a middleman device.

> Besides operating as a proxy, the ngioweb botnet could also be used to mount disruptive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

> Lumen took more than a year to analyze the botnet and its operations, and while it could not conclude exactly how the hardware was compromised, it speculated that it was most likely through various n-day vulnerabilities.

> At press time, the NSOCKS proxy, and the underlying ngioweb botnet are being heavily disrupted by Lumen and its partners, given that the researchers found both the botnet‚Äôs architecture, and traffic.",Dangerous global botnet fueling residential proxies is being hit in major crackdown | Lumen and partners disrupt operations of NSOCKS proxy,2024-11-24 03:46:44,0
