Especially as the top comment is someone recounting how their friend who had a similar thing happened was very messed up and developed anorexia? It’s weird you’re going out of your way to defend the bullies but then tell the girls to ‘laugh it off’.

I’m going to be real. It sounds like you prolly did similar crimes as the bullies and received repercussions and that’s why you’re going out of your way to defend them, but appear to have *less* sympathy for the victims and also ignore the psychological ill effects on them by claiming it’s ’fake images’. It’s kind of hypocritical as you use the excuse that the bullies have undeveloped brains - but don’t extend this to the victims? 

Recently, a 14 year old boy committed suicide due to bullying. Clearly being slut-shamed and having themselves be exposed would weigh heavier on a younger person who doesn’t yet have the maturity or long term thinking to see their options, and the magnitude of the shame and fear they feel is magnified.

220,"There's plenty of medium between laughing it off and telling the victim to get over it, and putting the boys in prison for years. The latter would never happen, what world are you living in? The Steubenville high school boys literally raped a girl on film and only got a year. And that's only because of national public backlash.

I am on the side of not being too lenient on these boys because that teaches them that sexual harassment is okay. There will be far greater consequences down the line if this behavior is not corrected. If this were my son, an entire summer's worth of community service would be in order here, as well as a very stern talking to from a sheriff or judge. And if the parents do not seem to be taking it seriously, a judge should make that call. Should get 150 hrs of community service and probation for a few months.

And for the girl, telling her to laugh it off is the worst possible advice and would accomplish the exact opposite. Parents should also not tell her she has to be traumatized forever, of course. Nobody said they should, so where did all this talk about ""victim mentality"" and ""overreaction types"" come from? You seem to be the type to fit every situation into your political bend.

Look-alikes and sound-alikes have been used in industry for *ages*, and if you tried to outlaw it, you'd cause infinitely more problems than you'd solve.

The rules governing it have basically always been that you can't falsely imply endorsement or association, and that would still apply perfectly to this situation.

400,"> AMD and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) announced today that the AMD-powered El Capitan has taken the top spot on the semi-annual Top500 list as the fastest-known supercomputer on the planet with 1.742 exaflops of performance. El Capitan debuts on the list at the top spot, catapulting over the previous leader, the 1.3 exaflop Frontier. The Intel-powered Aurora system fell to third place on the list—the system didn't submit a new benchmark run, implying that the partially operational system is still experiencing failure issues on numerous fronts.

> The sheer scale of El Capitan is mind-boggling — the system has 11,136 nodes packed with 44,544 of AMD's MI300A APUs, 5.4 petabytes of main memory, and an exceptionally performant 'Rabbit' near-node storage subsystem (more on those details below). El Capitan achieved 1.742 quintillion operations per second (exaflops) of performance in the benchmark, equivalent to doing one calculation every second for 54 billion years—but El Capitan does that amount of work every second. That's 45% faster than the second-fastest system on the list. 

> The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will use the system to modernize the US nuclear arsenal by simulating explosions to eliminate the need for underground detonations and simulate aging effects, safety, and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. The system will also be used to develop two new ICBM designs. The system will be used for HPC and AI workloads, or a fusion of the two.

> El Capitan boasts a theoretical peak (Rpeak) of 2.746 exaflops of performance. However, that number is calculated with the full performance of all system components operating at peak speeds with perfect linear performance scaling, which simply isn't feasible in the real world. 

> El Capitan's Rmax, a real-world performance measurement in the High-Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark that serves as the measuring stick for the top supercomputers, reached 1.742 exaflops in actual use. The Rmax could increase in the future with further system tuning, and the agency says it will do one more full-scale HPL benchmark before El Capitan is moved to a classified network.  

> It's also important to note that supercomputer system performance in HPL is measured with full double-precision FP64. In contrast, AI-centric supercomputers are measured with smaller data types that enable much higher 'AI exaflop' ratings, but those aren't directly comparable to the listings on the Top500 list. 

> El Capitan consumes >35 megawatts of power at full utilization and delivers 58.89 Gigaflops/watt, taking the 18th spot on the Green500 ranking of the most efficient supercomputers.

> El Capitan has an astounding total of 11,039,616 compute cores (CPU+GPU) spread across 44,544 AMD MI300A processors. These APUs blend both CPU and GPU cores into the same physical package. Each MI300A chip has 13 chiplets, many of them 3D-stacked, to create a single chip package with twenty-four Zen 4 CPU cores fused with a CDNA 3 graphics engine and eight stacks of HBM3 memory totaling 128GB. 

> Overall, the MI300A chip weighs in with 146 billion transistors, making it the largest chip AMD has pressed into production. The nine compute dies, a mix of 5nm CPUs and GPUs, are 3D-stacked atop four 6nm base dies that are active interposers that handle memory and I/O traffic, among other functions. You can see the deep dive of the El Capitan topology here. The architecture employs cache-coherent memory to reduce data movement between the CPU and GPU, which often consumes more power than the computation itself, thus reducing latency and improving performance and power efficiency. It also vastly simplifies both porting over older code and creating new code.

> HPE builds the El Capitan system with its Shasta architecture, which consists of high-density liquid-cooled EX4000 cabinets and EX225a accelerator blades tied together with the Slingshot-11 networking interconnect. This platform powers the DOE's other two exascale supercomputers: Frontier, the previous fastest supercomputer in the world, and the oft-delayed Aurora, which is powered by Intel silicon. That gives HPE the first, second, and third slots on the Top500 list, and all three are the first and only exascale-class systems on the list.

> For comparison, El Capitan is 45% faster than Frontier, the second-fastest super on the Top500 list. The AMD-powered Frontier now occupies the second spot on the Top500 list, giving the company another feather in its hat — AMD's silicon powers the two fastest supercomputers in the world. Interestingly, the Frontier supercomputer also has a new benchmark result for the list with a benchmark of 1.353 exaflops, an increase over the prior submission of 1.194. The Rpeak was also increased from 1.714 exaflops to 2.055 exaflops.",AMD-powered El Capitan is now the world's fastest supercomputer with 1.7 exaflops of performance — fastest Intel machine falls to third place on Top500 list | AMDomination.,2024-11-19 00:40:54,2
