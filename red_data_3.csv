- All your synced data goes to google servers, will the 3rd party be also buying your data?
- google may have to give control of subdomains to a 3rd party as chrome uses it for updates. I can see chrome connecting to so many different google domains it’s massively intertwined in their services. Even translating a webpage or the chrome web store, all google servers. It would be a big security issue for google to give a 3rd party control of their subdomains. Likely could be an opening for CORS exploits.
- it’s not profitable to run chrome on its own? 
- google contributes to the open source chromium, why would they still do this if they have to sell it? Then all other browsers will suffer - edge, brave etc
- google has a good reputation for fixing security bugs in chrome, drive by downloads will probably increase as a 3rd party struggles to give the same resources
- it’s not all that bad, in my opinion for a browser to have a monopoly, they can guide the web development field and it makes it easier for web developers, I remember writing css and js to support all the different browsers and even versions of IE. I like that chromium is dominant and honestly I only test and write code that works on a chromium based browser anymore.

So I think it is very very extremely important to get a regulatory body to be constructed which is safe from corruption if we want to ensure that the future stays in the hands of humans if we want the human race to remain organic.


Infiltration of AI into personal life has already started with the rising usage of tools like ChatGPT and Gemini which more often than not people have started believing blindly. If any bias is effecting the algorithms behind these tools then very soon without any rhyme or reason we will find companies and governments falling simply because of the domino effect that the suggestions of these tools can have towards our thinking.


The concept of a 'perfect' AI girlfriend is in itself bizzare and threatening. Giving the power to companies to decide what a 'perfect' girlfriend should be like will not only increase the human insecurities developing within individuals but also create unrealistic expectations among people which again will have a destructive effect on the concept of human relationships. With chatbots already coming into play, we have seen a rise in the number of people who would rather talk to a chatbot rather than a real human. 


I really hope we see some regulatory body being developed soon. Im honestly afraid of what AI has the potential to do to us.",Ex-Google CEO warns that 'perfect' AI girlfriends could spell trouble for young men | He suggested AI regulation changes but expects little action without a major incident.,2024-11-27 19:06:38,2

So many of them turn to and find comfort and community from online groups. And an AI girlfriend is just the next natural step. Most of them get laughed at for who they are and what they do already.
