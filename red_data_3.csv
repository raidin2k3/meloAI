Remember when Netflix was like $12/month, they had just about everything, and piracy was waaaaaay down? The pirates remember.

Point is: Piracy is not something the average consumer chooses to do by default. If that were the case, software companies of every size would be struggling to keep the lights on. It's when people feel like their options are limited that they turn to less-than-legal methods of acquisition. See also: Brazil's video game market.

200,"This is the take of someone who has decided their stance with little to no introspection or really any further thought or research into the topic at hand, and now they're being critical of others on the internet for not sharing their obviously unpopular stance. They are choosing a stance contrarian to popular opinion solely because of the vague sense of moral superiority it gives them, despite it being objectively flawed. Everyone should take note of how NOT to approach issues like this.

This reality is, consumers have shown time and time again that they are willing to pay fair prices for access to content. This is what made iTunes the biggest music delivery service of it's time and basically put contemporary file sharing platforms in the grave. This is what allowed Netflix to become so popular that it up-ended the entire TV and movies industry. Both are obviously paid services. 

But as content providers and telecom companies increasingly abuse their positions of power, people turn to piracy. This is compounded by the fact that these content providers are making their services worse-- injecting ads into already paid tiers, reducing quality unless users upgrade or use devices that share their data, restricting access to the point where it often inconveniences legitimate users, and removing content from their platforms after users have ""bought"" then (Sony and Discovery are examples of this), since you asked. All this while these same companies post eye-watering record profits.

Users are right to be dissatisfied with the state of streaming service offerings, and the market has shown before that it will likely respond appropriately until the content providers once again re-adjust their strategies.

There is nuance and details that make this issue more complex than ""PeOpLe MaD ThEy HaVe To PaY.""

Consumers have access to more content than they could ever consume. They have the ability to cancel and sign up for the service they want on a monthly basis- no contracts locking you in. You don’t NEED immediate access to every streaming service at the same time. Watch from one, cancel and watch from the next. 

But consumers have this idea that for some arbitrary amount they’ve decided is enough ($5/month, $10, etc) they should have on demand access to everything in existence and a litany of brand new things being released. And if they don’t get that, they’re somehow morally in the right to go and steal that product and consume it for free. 

And that’s simply unreasonable. If the product isn’t worth the value they’re asking for it, fine go read a book or go outside. Don’t take the content anyway.

My further point was that consumers are right to be dissatisfied with the state of the industry, and that the market will likely respond in the same way it has in the past.

This take also fails to factor in some important details about the content being offered; quantity is not the most important metric.

Over time, more and more studios began pulling out of Netflix and moving to different platforms. Then, following in Netflix's footsteps, all began investing in original programming.

Today, for the average consumer to catch the spread of content they may want to see, they have to subscribe to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Max, Disney+, etc. Instead of one or two subscription services that host the majority of content, we have tons, and they all keep raising prices constantly.

And I don’t agree that consumers are right to be dissatisfied with the state of the industry. They were given a free sample (Netflix keeping to unprofitable metrics to capture market share) and are now swinging back to realistic costs. Something has to give-you can’t have ad free content with $250M budgets without higher costs.
