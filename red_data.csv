151,"Unfortunately, having worked on American healthcare policy, I don’t see this working unless patients can bypass going directly to the pharmacy.

I attended a meeting in the US Capitol where a pharmacy chain owner came in to explain that the only reason his pharmacies could remain open is the kickbacks that they receive, and how corrupt drug pricing actually is.

Basically, people can try to get cheaper medications with coupons from places like goodrx. These coupons help the patient, but the insurance company is still charged the full price for the drug, so the pharmacy is more than happy to take coupons because it means they’ll get their money either way.

Cuban’s company mentions manufacturing Albendazole for its first drug, which would be nice as it cost me $400 per pill because my insurance didn’t cover it. However, Albendazole is one of those drugs that is kept in hospitals and very few pharmacies. How are we going to ensure that hospitals purchasing from Cuban’s Cost Plus aren’t inflating the cost to patients so that the regular cost of Albendazole is aligned with Cuban’s Cost Plus price? To my knowledge, you can’t bill Medicare/Medicaid different prices depending on who manufactured the drug given in a hospital. 

If pharmacies buy it, since there will be no ability for kickbacks, how can we ensure that pharmacies will not inflate the price? 

I hope his efforts to drive generic drug prices down work, because the way drugs are priced right now are *fucked.* For example: generic beta blockers (such as propranolol) are crazy expensive because pharmacies know that people on them *have* to buy them. They can’t stop their beta blocker cold turkey. A 30 day supply cost me $212 USD despite the fact it is a generic drug that has been around over 20 years. And I had to pay that because I didn’t have insurance at the time and didn’t want to end up in the hospital the next day.

Outside of cases like insulin, I'm conflicted. Sure people shouldn't have to pay ridiculous prices (especially people in the US compared to elsewhere in the world). However, doesn't this also potentially create the means to justify passivity toward the circumstances that created the need for the drug in the first place?

Yeah it's good to have an affordable price on that medication for your condition that you got from a lifetime of poor diet and overwork. What would be better is if you had a good diet and weren't overworked, so you wouldn't need the medication in the first case.

Yeah I know there are some cases where the conditions requiring medication are outside the person's control. As I said in the beginning of my comment, this is great for insulin and the like.

Problem is that a lot of diabetics don't do well on the cheaper stuff.  Some people really only respond to certain brands/regiments that sometimes takes years of trial and error to figure out...I think some of the insulins are still under patent.

The difference is mostly Obamacare reforms that created middlemen with monopolistic control of distribution. Three PBMs (Pharmacy benefits managers) control virtually all US drug distribution, and in the window since Obamacare real drug prices paid out to Pharmacutical companies have stayed flat. You probably saw the annual news reports this month that say ""Company A raises drug price 10%"".

Metformin which isn't insulin but a drug for people with type 2 diabetes is as low as $2 for 60 tablets.

Last I heard HHS was declining to implement any genuine regulation in line with the (pretty vague) terms of the executive order, citing the difficulty in turning the vague language into actionable regulation. It also seems difficult to work out what ""the lowest price offered in the world"" is, since pharmaceutical companies don't do their negotiations in public.

It looks to me like Trump's EO outlines a series of lofty goals but, since it's an EO, does nothing to regulate the industry. And it's an industry which spends up big with lobbyists to avoid any regulation on drug prices, they're already putting out talking points about how this sort of regulation would decrease investment and cost jobs, and that they'll take the issue to court if need be.

I dunno, these orders seem good but they need to be backed up by a government with the stones to follow through and enough regulatory power to bring pharmaceutical companies to heel.

1322,"This issue is right in my wheelhouse as I've been working with data on patents and lobbying, which are two big reasons why insulin is so expensive

The first big reason is that 3 companies control something like 90% of the Insulin market. The reason there's so little competition is a practice known as ""evergreening"" in which companies take advantage of loopholes in the U.S. patent system to ""build thickets"" of patents around their drugs which will make them last much longer.

I've been building a [dashboard tracking patents](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/) by publicly traded companies and if you search the ticker ""SNY"" (Sanofi) you'll see what I'm talking about.

The other big reason is lobbying. Pharma companies spend millions of dollars essentially buying votes to ensure that minimal legislative action is taken against price-gouging.

[Here's a dashboard](https://www.quiverquant.com/lobbyingsearch/) I've been building tracking corporate lobbying. You can search any pharma company (e.g. ""PFE"" for Pfizer) to see what specific pieces of legislation they're throwing money at.

1430,"GMOs are so vilified and it’s so off base. 

Here is a brief and indescribably non exhaustive list of the great things made possible by GMOs:

1.) greater yields - sure this benefits big dogs like Monsanto, but big picture we have less and less land to work with and any future will include being able to grow food on the land available. More food per acre = less people starving to death

2.) Plants can be designed to need less water and/or survive in climates that would otherwise be less than ideal - this make more varied foods more available to more people around the world while helping to conserve a precious resource. Varied domestic agriculture also limits necessity for international food transport and therefore any resultant pollution. 

3.) They can make plants resistant to pesticides or make the plant itself pest repellant - some may have a different opinion than me here and say that pesticides are bad and we shouldn’t use them (good luck with that) but this just goes back to making more food being a good thing for the world. 

4.) We can also design food to be more nutritious! This is especially true for global staples like rice! Google golden rice.

All this to say - Science and genetic tools like Crispr are great and will be essential in overcoming the challenges we are and will be facing as a civilization. I am so sick of Granola Karens lumping GMO’s into these kind of tirades with absolutely no scientific basis. Yes we have an issue with our diet as a country, but this stems from artificial and processed foods high in sugar, fats, carbs and cholesterol, not because your apple was genetically modified to brown less quickly. The tricky part is the fact that these genetic modifications are patented and controlled by corporations but hey, they are the ones forking over millions to pay for the science.

**The first product we are producing is Albendazole. Albendazole is an antiparasitic drug that currently has a list price of approximately $225 per tablet (currently listed average cash price per tablet on goodrx.com).**

**This means that many of the people who need the medicine can’t even afford the copays to treat their infections. At the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, our cost to make and distribute the drug is approximately $13.00 per tablet. We add a 15% profit margin and charge $15 per tablet as a wholesale price to pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, etc. We then set a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $20 per tablet. If you have insurance, the price can go down to less than a dollar a tablet.**

He can just make a 200% margin per pill instead of 20,000% and call it a day. Where he'll run into issues is patents.

1462,"Basically there's no money to be had by drug companies for generic meds anymore. 

Lots of manufacturers have left the generic scene as a result. When med gets to the point where only a small number of companies make it, they then can coordinate their prices with each other and raises prices in tandem. It's super illegal but still happens anyway because investigators generally can't prove the collusion to fix prices and/or the punishment is just too weak and is built into the companies' budget for the year. 

This also opens us up to severe shortages like during Puerto Rico's hurricane crises a few years back that knocked out a large chunk of the manufacturing capabilities of two of the three companies that make IV fluid bags.

Another common pathway to more expensive drugs are when a single company does their research and applies for an Orphan drug designation on an old generic. The FDA grants the patent and then the company takes over all production of a med and jacks up the price to treat a rare disease. Colchicine is a good example of this one.

Also I see a lot of meds go on shortage for months or even years, then come back at 4 or 5 times the price when demand has skyrocketed. No idea what shittiness is going on there. Usually the claims are either supply side (i.e. not enough glass vials to store product allegedly cause a sodium bicarbonate shortage years ago) or within the manufacturing process itself that the FDA puts under review. Of course when you offline a third of your production capability like that because this also happens in addition to my first example of less companies manufacturing, supply dwindles and drives prices up.",Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.

Typically the purpose of a brand name is that it provides some novel benefit over the generic.  That's not me saying this, but the industries excuse for charging a premium on the drug.

Biologics, like a lot of these newer anti-inflammatory drugs, such as humira, are produced through complex chemical and biological steps, which even after patent expiry are still difficult to reproduce. These don't really have 'generics' but more Bio-similar competitors that achieve the same function.

Insulin is much closer to the biologic end of the spectrum, but has more reproducable production. **There is absolutely significant, and disgusting price gouging in the insulin market,** but it does require significant investment to have the capability to produce insulin.

However, the margins/volume involved make this rather meaningless as most drugs will make back their investment very quickly.

1612,"I honestly fear that there is currently to much focus on the big pharmacy companies and not the complicated system of middle men, that increases the prices. The truth is that these companies only have limited competition all over the world, but it is only in the USA that you see these outrageous prices.

A lot of Novo Nordisk research and production happens in what is called the medicon valley. An area of eastern Denmark and southern Sweden. Here people have been outrage against Novo Nordisk, because of the high insulin prices in the USA. People should not be dying because they can’t afford something as cheap as insulin.

The CEO of Novo-nordisk(Lars) have engaged with the public in a number of back and forth Letters to the editor of several newspapers. [Here](https://www.berlingske.dk/laesere/novo-nordisk-vi-er-bevidst-om-vores-samfundsansvar ) is one of the letters. Lars (The CEO of Novo Nordisk) say that Novo Nordisk earns the same on insuline at the american market as on every other market. The listed price is just higher, because the bulkbuyers demands increased discount each year and so the listed price have to increase each year.

It actuelly goes very well with my experience and knowledge of bulkbuyers in the american market. Bulkbuyers in general used to just buy in bulk, get a discount and then resell the products. Some times it was worth using a bulkbuyer. Sometimes it wasn’t. Then a few decades ago bulkbuyers in the USA started to change practice. Bulkcompanies would get hired by the company that needed a given product, by saying that they could get a better discount and that the companies would just have to pay them a small percentage of the discount. It is an easy sell. We get you a discount, then you pay us a percentage of the discount or else you can just pay the listed price of the company.

The problem was that when these bulkcompanies had gained almost monopoly on a market, because the only way that the bulkbuyers could increase their profit was by demanding more and more discount each year. Manufactores would then increase listed prices by the same amount each year and still earn the same amount. The problem is that Bulkbuyers actuelly want manufactures to raise the listed price, because that increase how much their discount is worth and thus their profit. It also kind of catches the companies who needs the products. They have to stay with the bulkcompany, since the original product is now to expensive to buy without the bulkcompany.

So let us say that Novo-nordic sells a drug for $30. The bulkcompany comes in and say that they can get it cheaper but want 20% of the discount. Over the next decade they demand a greater and greater discount, the manufacture agrees to the discount, but raises the listed price. The listed price of the drug is now $300, but the bulkcompany gets a 90% discount, so the pharmacy can still buy the druge for $30 from the manufacture, but the bulkcompany get 20% of the now $270 discount, which is $54. A cost that is then pushed to the consumer.

These numbers might seem extreme, but [this](https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/amerikaner-i-desperat-opraab-efter-nye-prisstigninger-fra-novo-de ) article in a danish business newspaper looks at some of the numbers for Novo-nordic and even with a 370% price increase, Novo-nordisks profit on insuline on the american market have not even followed inflation, because they are giving almost 80% discount to the bulkcompanies. A huge discount that the bulk companies are paid for and that pay is then moved to the consumer.

In other letters and articles Lars have talked about the problems Novo Nordisk have faced trying to bring cheap generic insuline to the american public. Novo Nordisk had according to him tried to find partners for years, before they were able to sell human insuline through Walmart. None of their normal partners wanted to take part in it, because while it could bring cheaper insuline to the consumers it might cut down their profit.

Of course what he says should be taken with a grain of salt. He is after all the CEO of Novo Nordisk, but on the other hand he doesn’t get that much out of lying about the american market to a danish audience. His articles paint the american healthcare system as unnecessary complicated, bloated and fundamentally flawed, with need for governmental intervention to bring it back in control, so that it serves the population and not the companies.",Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.

1666,"> The first big reason is that 3 companies control something like 90% of the Insulin market. The reason there's so little competition is a practice known as ""evergreening"" in which companies take advantage of loopholes in the U.S. patent system to ""build thickets"" of patents around their drugs which will make them last much longer.

This is only part of the reason. The other reason is the FDA itself. Even if evergreening completely stopped today and all the patents were wide open. It's incredibly difficult to get FDA approval on the drugs who's patents have expired. With small molecule drugs it's far easier to make exactly the molecule you want and to prove that your drug is what you say it is. With something like insulin were talking about a massive complex molecule often over 100 times larger than a small molecule drug. And for this reason, you might have some slight differences. 

The FDA has been incredibly slow to approve these biosimilars and they are a MASSIVE hurdle that's holding back competition from entering the market. https://clinical.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/4/138",Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.

1777,"Yep. Metformin is the first line of treatment for T2 diabetics in most cases. T1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder caused by your immune system attacking and destroying the Islet of Langerhans cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Hence, your body gets no insulin at all and it HAS to be supplied from an outside source. T2 is caused by the body not producing the amount of insulin it needs to regulate perpetually high blood sugar levels, meaning that those levels need to be decreased to keep from destroying your kidneys over time. Both supplementing insulin and lowering your blood sugar back down to normal levels can help with T2 diabetes and can keep it in check. T1s aren't so lucky.

1854,"Depends on the drugs. A lot of medical research and production happens in what is called the medicon valley. An area of eastern Denmark and southern Sweden. Here people have been outrage against Novo Nordisk, because of the high insulin prices in the USA. People should not be dying because they can’t afford something as cheap as insulin.

The CEO of Novo-nordisk(Lars) have engaged with the public in a number of back and forth Letters to the editor of several newspapers. [Here](https://www.berlingske.dk/laesere/novo-nordisk-vi-er-bevidst-om-vores-samfundsansvar ) is one of the letters. Lars (The CEO of Novo Nordisk) say that Novo Nordisk earns the same on insuline at the american market as on every other market. The listed price is just higher, because the bulkbuyers demands increased discount each year and so the listed price have to increase each year.

It actuelly goes very well with my experience and knowledge of bulkbuyers in the american market. Bulkbuyers in general used to just buy in bulk, get a discount and then resell the products. Some times it was worth using a bulkbuyer. Sometimes it wasn’t. Then a few decades ago bulkbuyers in the USA started to change practice. Bulkcompanies would get hired by the company that needed a given product, by saying that they could get a better discount and that the companies would just have to pay them a small percentage of the discount. It is an easy sell. We get you a discount, then you pay us a percentage of the discount or else you can just pay the listed price of the company.

The problem was that when these bulkcompanies had gained almost monopoly on a market, because the only way that the bulkbuyers could increase their profit was by demanding more and more discount each year. Manufactores would then increase listed prices by the same amount each year and still earn the same amount. The problem is that Bulkbuyers actuelly want manufactures to raise the listed price, because that increase how much their discount is worth and thus their profit. It also kind of catches the companies who needs the products. They have to stay with the bulkcompany, since the original product is now to expensive to buy without the bulkcompany.

So let us say that Novo-nordic sells a drug for $30. The bulkcompany comes in and say that they can get it cheaper but want 20% of the discount. Over the next decade they demand a greater and greater discount, the manufacture agrees to the discount, but raises the listed price. The listed price of the drug is now $300, but the bulkcompany gets a 90% discount, so the pharmacy can still buy the druge for $30 from the manufacture, but the bulkcompany get 20% of the now $270 discount, which is $54. A cost that is then pushed to the consumer.

These numbers might seem extreme, but [this](https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/amerikaner-i-desperat-opraab-efter-nye-prisstigninger-fra-novo-de ) article in a danish business newspaper looks at some of the numbers for Novo-nordic and even with a 370% price increase, Novo-nordisks profit on insuline on the american market have not even followed inflation, because they are giving almost 80% discount to the bulkcompanies. A huge discount that the bulk companies are paid for and that pay is then moved to the consumer.

In other letters and articles Lars have talked about the problems Novo Nordisk have faced trying to bring cheap generic insuline to the american public. Novo Nordisk had according to him tried to find partners for years, before they were able to sell human insuline through Walmart. None of their normal partners wanted to take part in it, because while it could bring cheaper insuline to the consumers it might cut down their profit.

Of course what he says should be taken with a grain of salt. He is after all the CEO of Novo Nordisk, but on the other hand he doesn’t get that much out of lying about the american market to a danish audience. His articles paint the american healthcare system as unnecessary complicated, bloated and fundamentally flawed, with need for governmental intervention to bring it back in control, so that it serves the population and not the companies.",Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.

And if they don't oblige, they go with the competition (Sanofi, Eli Lilly or Mylan) so Novo (and sanofi and so on) increased their discount every year, but that also causes them to increase msrp.

The only issue is the pharmacy cannot buy the drug at $30 as you say the pharmacy is having to pay close to the list price.

High RX drug prices are not from your physicians getting paid under the table. Physicians getting kick backs on drugs is an extremely rare occurrence. If your worried, there’s a federal system to see every $ a pharma has given to a physician directly or indirectly (ie. Purchasing them lunch). Your skepticism is not unfounded though. Lobbying by drug companies (notably pain management) pushed physicians to over RX pain-killers because they would actually be fined/reprimanded if they did not. Pharma sales also relied on predatory tactics like using attractive young women and lavish conferences to directly lobby physicians to use X drug. You should be mad at the government and pharma lobbyists for this happening. This has been reversed and no longer occurs in such capacity.

Me and a large group of people worked 80 hour weeks at a startup for years, basically ruining our health and making ourselves miserable during the prime of our lives. The startup blew up, a real notable startup story, but of course we didn't get rich. The founders did. Then (most) of us started our own businesses. We have varying levels of success, but none of us are billionaires, to say the least. And some of these people were incredibly intelligent and charismatic. 

Luck. Luck is the hidden factor. You can be as hardworking and smart and charismatic as can be. You can be a fucking visionary. But if you don't happen to meet that right person at the right time, or have that random lucky break, you'll never be cuban-esque successful, or even anything close to it. Intelligence and dedication are the foundation, but luck is that magic factor that sends people to great success. 

It bothers me when people like Cuban can't just step up and say ""I got mad fuckin' lucky."" And instead push this ""I worked hard, you gotta work hard"" nonsense.

2141,"Hi type 1 diabetic here.  That means one day my immune system decided to attack the beta cells in my pancreas (the cells produce insulin) meaning my body can no longer regulate my blood sugar on its own. The biggest thing that diabetics need to account for is total carbohydrates in food.  It doesn't matter what the source is, eventually it will be broken down into glucose and my body has no way of dealing with it from there without synthetic insulin. Another issue is the liver constantly produces glucose and releases it into the blood, this is the reason type 1 diabetics need a basal insulin (the Walmart insulins are basal). They are akin to a controlled release medication in that they last longer than the three main fast acting insulins (Humalog made by Lilly, Novolog made by Novo Nordisc, and Apidra made by Sanofi).

The fast acting insulins are the ones that are bankrupting people. If you have a pump then it is acting as the basal by slowly relasing insulin throughout the day. I take injections twice a day with a combination of Humalog and Humulin N (or Novolin N which is available at Walmart for a reasonable price). Another issue with these is, while they are all fairly close in formulations some people do not react the same to them all equally. I personally cannot take Apidra as it does not work nearly as effectively as Humalog or Novalog. Unfortunately my insurance only covers Apidra so I need to jump through hoops along with my doctor to convince them Humalog is the best treatment option for me, otherwise it will cost me $100 a vial. That is not nearly as much as an uninsured person would have to pay as it was about $385 a vial last I checked.

Sorry I went on a bit of a tangent but to summarize an answer to your question, no Type 1 Diabetics need insulin no matter what.

People with type 2 in its early stages can usually control their diabetes with diet which is why some people can overcome pre diabetes without developing it. People with type 1 produce 0 insulin, their blood sugar is much more unstable and can drop/spike in a matter of ten minutes. Both types need to get some carbs so their blood sugar doesn’t get too low, but type 2s can sometimes prevent spikes with strict diet.

For two changing what you eat could even help reverse the sickness — like eating pills instead of injecting insulin.


For one — changing foods can help you to easier regulate your blood sugar. Pizza is really hard to take insulin for as it raises your blood sugar in different stages.

2198,"It will vary person to person.

My son is on MDI (multiple daily injections, just a fancy way of saying we can't afford a pump). For our situation the actual insulin he needs is the most affordable part of T1D.

When on MDI you take two kinds of insulin. A daily basal (background) insulin to smooth the day out and combat your body's natural glucose rise, in addition to a rapid insulin every time you eat.

We dose meal time insulin using a carb:insulin ratio of 8:1. Everyone's ratio is different and requires a lot of trial and error to fine tune it. So every time he eats anything we have to calculate the total carbs he's about to consume, and divide by 8 to get the number of units of insulin he'll need to inject prior to eating.

He is 11 and growing like a weed, so his daily needs are going up but right now, on average, uses 30-40 units of rapid insulin per day and 25 units of basal insulin per day.

There are a bunch of different types of rapid and basal insulin, each with their pros and cons and you have to just kind of figure out what works best for your body. My son uses Humalog for his rapid insulin, and Lantus for his basal insulin.

A box of 1500 units of Humalog is $69 CAD without insurance.

A box of 1500 units of Lantus is $107 CAD without insurance.

So that means 1 box of humalog lasts us about a month (1500u / 40u per day is 37 days but there is a bit of waste each time you prime the pen needle prior to injection).

And that 1 box of Lantus lasts us about 2 months (1500u / 25u per day is 60 days, but note the same waste occurs with priming the Lantus pen as well).

Some quick maths says our total out of pocket cost per month for just insulin (not factoring needles, test strips, etc) would be about $122.50/mo

A box of 100 pen needles is about $95 without insurance, and he gets about 5 injections per day, so that means we need a box and a half per month, so that would be about $142 for pen needles.

We done use test strips much. We use the Freestyle Libre, which is a 14-day (flash reader) continuous gluclose monitor. Each freestyle sensor is $97 each. So at least two per month (28 days) is $194. Test strips actually cost more if you test more than 7 times per day (and you should).

Just for the NBA look at how much James Dolan has set the Knicks back or how many moves that Vivek Ranadive has pushed for that has blown up in the Kings faces? In the NFL- look no further than one of Dallas's other owners in Jerry Jones- he likely cut the Cowboys dynasty in the 90's a few years short and was a key reason they were in perpetual mediocrity for over a decade after. Dan Snyder seemingly has stepped back from his meddling ways in recent years, but the Name Redacted is still pretty well known for how toxic the front office and organization was for years in part because of Snyder's cronyism. 

All of those owners are massive fans of their team's and sport outside of maybe Dolan. Hands on is great when the person is intelligent about it but can also be the worst thing for a sports franchise.

On the flip side, I (Boston sports fan) didn't even know who the Celtics leading owner was until the past few years because Wyc Grousbeck is rather private. He is at games but doesn't like to be in the limelight and instead leaves the team operations to Danny Ainge, Mike Zarren, and currently Brad Stevens (the coach)- all three are very good at what they do (Ainge at building a sustainable team, Zarren with crunching the numbers, and Stevens coaching the team and having input on acquisitions and departures) 

Edit: Saw someone below that gave me a perfect example of a hands off owner who is terrible- Bob Nutting of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The largest FA deal he has ever given out is 3/39 million and the second largest is 3/26 million. He has no other deals that have gotten past 20 million total.

You dose pro-actively based on a carb:insulin ratio 15 minutes before a meal to prevent high b/g levels.

Everyone has a natural insulin resistance, his is quite high. I run a T1D support group in my area and see a hugh variance of dosing amounts. My son is on the high end of the curve there but one girl I know takes 45 units of basal and doses 5:1 carb:insulin ratio for her rapid. She's just reached adulthood, and is very healthy and normal looking (not over weight). There is also this one kid my sons age that gets 9 units of Lantus and does 15:1 rapif ratio. He is a bit smaller than my son, though.

Less carbs does mean less insulin. He's 11 and in the early stages of puberty which also affects dosage, he needs more insulin than he did before and it will likely level off as he finishes growing in his later teen years.

He's very active, and would eat a truck load of food if we'd let him. We encourage low carb, high fibre foods but a growing boy's gotta eat. He's very tall, as tall as his mother already, and average build.

You should dose basal insulin based on fasting b/g rate. Anymore and he could go too low which is even worse than high b/g, and lows at night while sleeping/fasting could kill him in his sleep.

2406,"Evidently you don't know what 'race to the bottom' means.

> The race to the bottom refers to a competitive situation where a company, state, or nation attempts to undercut the competition's prices **by sacrificing quality standards or worker safety** (often defying regulation), or reducing labor costs

> the term race to the bottom is used to characterize unhinged tit-for-tat competition **that has crossed ethical lines and could be destructive for the parties involved**

> The race to the bottom is thus a result of cutthroat competition. When companies engage in the race to the bottom, its impact is felt beyond the immediate participants. **Lasting damage can be done to the environment, employees, the community, and the companies’ respective shareholders**. Moreover, consumer expectations of ever lower prices may mean that **the eventual victor finds profit margins permanently squeezed**. If consumers confront poor quality goods or services as a result of cost cutting during the race to the bottom, **the market for those goods or services could dry up**

So no, trying to undercut your competitors by *just* lowering your prices isn't a 'race to the bottom'; the term is used when you try to undercut your competitors by any and all means available, including ""sacrificing quality standards or worker safety"".

Deregulation is a slippery slope to a race to the bottom and as I said previously, this ends up hurting consumers (and pretty much most other people).

2425,"> My point is that government intervention is not the problem 

No. That conclusion doesn't follow from your premises. 

The only thing we can conclude from what you said so far is that government invention does not always drive up the price of insulin in particular. 

Which no one has claimed in the first place, only that it did in this particular case. Which is true. 

So, what do we do if someone has cornered the market in insulin, and is jacking up the price? Well, there might be many solutions, but there are two in particular that we might find interesting to talk about. 

The first is the socialist solution, which is basically to pay their exorbitant prices with taxpayer dollars. This solves the problem of price, but not the problem of scarcity. 

The second is the free market solution, which is to cease whatever government action is enabling the cartel in the first place, and allow competitors into the market. 

Since insulin can be manufactured cheaply, and pharmaceutical don't have gangs of mercenary warriors putting their competitors out of business directly, they MUST be relying on government to do it. The two major pathways by which this can happen are intellectual property law, and regulatory capture.

Why does this seem to be such a common belief on Reddit?  I feel like no one actually is aware of what policies are in place in the rest of the world.

I am saying this with NO political agenda here.

Bernie's specific policy proposals are left of the leftmost European countries.  

Bernie's Medicare for All proposal doesn't resemble any European country.  On the one hand, you can argue that Denmark, Canada, and the UK are further left (the government owns the hospitals, whereas France, Netherlands, etc have private hospitals), but on the other hand, Medicare for All:


* Bans all private insurance (no Euro country does this)
* Allows non-citizens to use the insurance (no Euro country does this; foreigners pay at cost)
* has no copays (only Denmark does this, no one else)
* covers dental and vision for free (I don't believe any Euro country does this)


It *is* left of Europe.


Similarly, the wealth tax.  Bernie proposed an 8% wealth tax.   The highest wealth tax in the entire world is 1.3% in the Netherlands.

Similarly, the stock trading tax.  Bernie proposed 0.5% each way (1% round trip).  The highest stock trading tax in the world is 0.2% in France.  Sweden went higher, but it was disastrous and repealed.


Similarly, Bernie's [Corporate Democracy](https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/) proposal is basically what Germany does- makes 30% of board members be employee representatives- except Bernie proposes 45% *plus* requires  the companies to give 20% of their stock to the workers. And remember, only Germany does this.


Bernie's proposals are almost all universally left of the leftmost examples you can find in Europe.  **I am making no statement as to whether that is a good or bad thing.** But I keep hearing over and over again that he's not and I keep wondering if people even know what policies are in place in Europe.",Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.

2495,"What answer were you looking for?

Yes, Lily and Nordisk have a wide array of cost saving measures. Lily even runs a diabetes resource center that they established in 2018, which, curiously, coincided with a congressional inquiry into their insulin pricing practices.

On paper, these cost savings measures look great. They wouldn't need to exist, of course, if the list price of Humalog U100 wasn't almost $600, but at least they're trying to help impoverished diabetics, right?

In practice, it's a needlessly complicated, Kafkaesque maze of coupons, PBMs, and poorly advertised savings programs. Lily expects the sick, the weak, the newly diagnosed, to navigate this byzantine dungeon, often by themselves, or else, guess what? They have to pay the list price.

All these complexities could be avoided if Lily simply lowered the list price. But by jacking up the price, they can have their cake and eat it too, scraping as much money as they can out of the hands of rich and poor alike. And the burden of finding ways to afford this life saving medication is, of course, on the consumer. And there will always be consumers who fail to fully navigate the system, perhaps because they are too stressed or sick. That's more money for Lily! The Big Pharma version of customers tossing out gift cards that still have some cash on them.

And if Lily was faced with controversy? They could just point at their savings programs. Look how much we're helping, they say, while conveniently ignoring that it is they who created the problem that they are allegedly trying to solve. It's the perfect price gouging machine, a grotesque house of cards meant to extract as much cash as humanly possible from every income bracket while still providing insulin.

It would be like if the only store in town jacked the price of toilet paper up to $50 a roll, then rolled out a bunch of ""savings programs"" to help people afford it. They could simply lower the price to a saner amount, but they make a lot more money this way, right?

I am left to wonder-- if these savings programs are so great, why did I, personally, deliver three vials of insulin to a fellow diabetic who could not afford her insulin a month ago? Why was she also buying Lantus from her uncle? Why did I smuggle a life saving medication, literally under the cover of darkness, as if I were living in North Korea? You've probably heard about the Insulin Underground. I am one of the stops.

We can exchange opposing narratives all day and we'll get nowhere. Why don't we just look at the objective facts?

Fact: insulin is a necessary medication for insulin dependent diabetics. They cannot choose to not take it, or else they will die. They cannot exit the market.

Fact: insulin was first synthesized in 1922 and began being mass produced in 1923.

Fact: the cost of a vial of Humalog U100 was $21 in 1999. In 2009, it was $93. In 2014, it rose sharply to $290. By 2017, the list price had skyrocketed to nearly $600. Lily and Nordisk, mysteriously increased their prices together in a lockstep, so a diabetic could not seek another brand if the price was too high. The price hikes mysteriously stopped after public outcry and a congressional inquiry in 2017.

Fact: a quarter of insulin dependent diabetics reported rationing their insulin in 2019 due to the cost.

Fact: in 2017, Alec Smith-Holt attempted to ration his insulin after losing his health insurance. He succumbed to DKA. His mother brought his ashes to Sanofi headquarters in 2018.

Fact: Humalog netted Lilly Pharmaceuticals $3 *billion* in global revenue in 2018.

Fact: in a move eerily similar to the EpiPen Cost Crisis of 2016, Lilly began marketing a generic version of Humalog at 50% reduced cost (merely making it approximately the 2014 list price). These large discounts pulled abruptly out of thin air indicate that the high list price is arbitrary.

Fact: the Insulin Underground exists. Diabetics are quietly distributing insulin to those in need, despite such actions being against the law. The Underground has only grown amidst the covid 19 pandemic.

Fact: Lilly Pharmaceuticals could choose to reduce the list price by significant amounts and still net billions in profit.

Fact: the myriad of byzantine savings programs would not need to exist if Lilly and others simply lowered the list price

These are the facts.

One could point at the savings programs and shout till their face turns blue, but the truth remains: thousands of diabetics are rationing their insulin and suffering health consequences as a result of the high price. Yet the burden is on them to navigate these programs and claw back savings, no matter how sick or stressed they may be.

Diabetics are suffering. They are smuggling these little vials of liquid gold around as though we are living in North Korea. This is, quite simply, a crime against humanity-- jacking up the price of a necessary medication that patients cannot refuse to take. Parents are refinancing their homes to pay for their sick children's medication.

And this would all go away, as if my magic... If only the companies would lower the list price.

The question remains, what are the benefits of this current system, especially in light of the alternative of simply dropping the price? And what kind of monster would support this nonsense? I'm guessing you have a career in Big Pharma, and I'm guessing you drank the Kool Aid regarding the savings programs Lilly and others have scrambled to implement recently. 

I do not believe in hell. That should comfort me. Instead, I'm disappointed to find that there is no hell for everyone who has a hand in the high price of insulin to go to. What a shame.

I suggest you further educate yourself about the sufferings and difficulties of this current ""high price, but look at our savings programs"" nonsense.

2502,"The socialist solution is not to pay exorbitant prices for insulin! That's fantasy. 

The socialist solution is to empower healthcare systems, not pharmaceutical companies. Pricing for these drugs is capped at policy level and reviewed regularly in countries with socialised healthcare. It effectively forbids the healthcare system from paying above a certain price. These countries are enormous markets and as you say, insulin is cheap to manufacture - companies will not, and have not, withdraw insulin from entire countries because their profits are insufficient. The result is that insulin is cheap for the state healthcare system and consequently cheap for people, both in terms of point-of-use and taxation.

There is already a near-monopoly on insulin production, the barriers to entry are extremely high. The free market solution hasn't done anything in the US except to allow pharma companies, insurers and distributors to progressively hike prices without any oversight.

Also the % of people living in poverty hasn't declined if you:

a) take socialist China out of the equation (where majority of the gains have actually happened)

b) you either use the ethical (or any more realistic) poverty lines that have been recommended by economists across multiple countries, or you use unique poverty lines which are more reflective of each individual country's economic situation.

Yeah, exactly. 

I said some things that you didn't understand, because you don't know the context. There's a whole history behind this. You're seeing ""Insulin + United States"" as a mere example or talking point for the policy you want to advocate. 

But it's a very specific situation with a whole history behind it, that starts with Richard Nixon, moves through a scientist corrupted by corporate money, and then the government steps in and really ruins everything. 

In fact, we are in the midst of a pandemic that makes Covid look like the sniffles... but most people don't even know about it, because it kills slowly. 

But there's zero chance I can explain it to you, because when someone is already in an argument, it's almost impossible for them to stop treating what they hear as a talking point they need to refute, rather than an explanation of something they don't know. 

So the only way to get you to look is to spark your curiosity.

2665,"Okay, so maybe I did trigger your curiosity a little bit. Good. 

Maybe you've heard something about us being in a multi-decade ""obesity epidemic""? That's... sort of true, but sort of not. Because obesity isn't the disease... it's the symptom. 

In other words, we are suddenly surrounded by fat people (as compared to, say, the 70s) not because there was a sudden unexplained outbreak of gluttony and laziness, but because something is *causing* this. 

*People are not sick because they are fat. They are fat because they are sick.*

It's called ""metabolic syndrome"", and it's caused by a substance called ""fructose"", which is both addictive and hepatotoxic. 

What does this have to do with the government? Well, most terrible fuckups start with the government, and, in the United States, most recent terrible fuckups started with Richard Nixon. Long story short, the interaction of government with big-industry lobbying and research fraud is the reason why this stuff is in almost everything you eat. 

But what does that have to do with insulin? Well, simple. Muscle insulin insensitivity and type 2 adult-onset diabetes are two of the major symptoms of fructose heptotoxicity. This IS metabolic syndrome. 

In short, **we have a LOT more people who need insulin now, and it's only going to get worse**.

2674,"Thank you. I've not had time to watch the video yet (I've just woken up and I'm starting work soon) but I've read through the post and will get to the video over the weekend. 

I actually do know a bit about it - HFCS is added to tons of US foods (and around the world) as a dirt-cheap sweetener, right? Not just sweets and soft drinks, but stuff like bread. It's produced from corn (hence the name) and is metabolised extremely quickly as it's so highly refined, which makes it more addictive than other forms of sugar as the sugar spike is quicker, and increases the risk of diabetes. It's incredibly cheap because of corn industry subsidies and because it uses byproducts that otherwise don't have a use, as I understand. 

Although it is used here in Europe, the last stats I can find (2012) give a per-capita consumption of under 1lb per person here in the UK, compares to 55lbs (!!) In the US. 

I won't press the point, since it's not really the topic any more, but in my opinion it's another thing that can be solved by (the right kind of) government intervention. When you've got to the point of your population consuming 55lbs per year of a quickly-metabolised junk sugar which is heavily linked to type 2 diabetes and which finds its way in huge quantities into things like bread, honey, breakfast cereal, soft drinks, condiments and salad dressings, ready meals... you've got a public health crisis. We've had several top-down measures to curb sugar consumption in recent years and they're been largely effective - restrictions on advertising, higher tax (on manufacturers and sellers) on sugar in drinks, mandatory improved food labeling, things like that.  

I'm in agreement that it's a huge public health crisis. However it's done, something needs to happen to reduce to cost of US insulin, particularly since diabetes rates are steadily increasing - and something needs to happen to reduce HFCS consumption too. Whatever those solutions might be - and I believe we disagree on the best way to go about it - we both agree on the problem.

2681,"Oh, you're a European? 

That makes a *lot* more sense. Europeans' view and experience of government-control strategies is very different, and they tend to have trouble understanding why Americans are so hostile to government interference. 

Look, I *know* that state-run healthcare, where you are, is something you're happy with, but *our* federal government ain't like that. It fucks up everything it touches, and the only reason we have a pretty good country anyway is that large portions of our population are very hostile to letting it touch things. 

In fact, a government fuckup is the whole reason Americans consume so much HFCS in the first place. Yes, they caused this. 

How? Well, Richard Nixon wanted to take the price of food out of the political picture, to make it no longer an issue in elections. Enter corn subsidies (later also for soybeans). Now, these aren't as huge as most people think... about 10% to a farmer's bottom line if I recall correctly, but that little bit adds up. 

This has a cascade effect, where cheap corn and soybeans means that you can make cheap processed ""food"", and the more you learn about making this kind of ""food"", the more demand you have for corn and soybeans. Nixon just wanted people to have enough to eat, so they'd vote Republican. But he accidentally kicked off the greatest mass poisoning in history. 

Which brings us to our second villain, Ansel Keys. It's unclear whether he was corrupted by money from all these corporations that had sprung up that were heavily invested in processed ""food"", or whether he was just an incompetent jackass, but this idiot published studies pushing the conclusion that dietary fat was the primary contributing factor to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. 

He apparently didn't know that when you do an ANOVA, you have to do it *both fucking ways*. (It's okay if you don't know what that means. Just know that every actuary and statistician who reads that sentence will do an immediate facepalm.)

So the second way that government created this problem was that they listened to this clown and brought us the ""food pyramid"". Look it up if you're not familiar, but be aware that some sources you find on the web are still in favour of this nonsense, even 50 years later. But it's not just children's education... all nutritional labeling in the US, and pretty much anything the FDA and USDA say about nutrition are based on this fraud. 

So, the government created the epidemic with (1) bad agricultural subsidies and (2) bad nutritional guidelines. 

The third leg of the tripod is how government prevented us from addressing the problem, by ruining the heathcare industry. 

Since you live in Europe, and only have what you hear secondhand, you may think that healthcare in the US is entirely private. It's not. We have something called ""Medicare"", which is a nationalized health insurance service for retirees and the disabled. It's huge, and, like the proverbial 400 lb gorilla, it sleeps wherever it wants, and pays whatever it decides to. 

Medicare has a schedule of rates for every procedure and diagnosis, based on ICD-10. And, for complex economic reasons, even private insurance companies are forced to follow suit. 

But this schedule of rates provides almost no payment for preventive and diagnostic care. Because of medicare, **you cannot make a living as a general-practice doctor in the United States.** There are no independent GPs in the US anymore. They went broke, because if they raised their prices to a rate that met their expenses, Medicare wouldn't pay, and they had no patients. 

They had to beg the hospitals to take them back. Now the hospitals run them as [*loss leader*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader)... which means that their job, the moment they walk in the room, is to either get the patient out the door as fast as possible, or refer them to a specialist who is actually allowed to make money. 

*Primary care doctors in the United States talk to you with one hand on the door, even if you have 'gold standard' health insurance.* So what do you suppose that does to diagnosis and treatment of a complex multi-systemic whole-body disorders like metabolic syndrome? 

Most of these guys have never heard of it and have no idea what to do about it if they have. Our healthcare system literally waits for people to develop Type 2 Diabetes and then treats that with insulin. 

* Can you understand now why we have an insulin shortage? 
* Can you understand now why we are hostile to the idea of price controls? (Given that price controls got us here in the first place.)
* And can you please stop doing that European thing where if an American does something that doesn't make sense to you, you assume we are all idiots, rather than that maybe there just might be something going on over here you don't know about?

- Healthcare should be available to all citizens
- Healthcare should be easy to navigate
- Healthcare should be as inexpensive as possible

(That third point being both inexpensive at point of use, and inexpensive in terms of tax expenditure) 

And to distil down (some of) the obstacles to that: 

- Nutritional advice is heavily influenced by the food industry and based on flawed research (the fat-is-the-evil also filtered through here - we had similar problems)
- Agricultural producers are incentivised to produce junk sugars by subsidies
- Medicare is an unholy alliance of nationalised healthcare, captured by the existing private sector and at the mercy of poorly regulated insurers, pharma companies and middlemen
- Hospitals themselves are private and therefore profit-driven, meaning that general doctors (we call them GPs here) aren't actively discouraged from preventative and pre-diagnostic work

You've definitely helped me understand your aversion to government intervention. Given that - what's the solution? Can it be solved? Do you just tear it all down? How does any of this get better?

2686,"> it's not a problem with government intervention conceptually, it's a systemic problem

Well, just about any system works in theory, except communism. Hell, even monarchy works if your monarch is uncharacteristically talented, benevolent, and a good judge of character. 

What's special about free markets is that they work *even if people are greedy*. In fact, they work *because* people are greedy. Free markets are the one system where individual goals and group goals align. 

> Correct me if I'm wrong, here, but I'm making an assumption that you share a common set of goals or desired outcomes with me {etc etc etc}

Well, duh.

This is actually something I see a lot. A leftist realizes that a right winger cares about problems and wants them fixed, and is *surprised*. As if this were some sort of unusual thing. 

Dude, we're *all* like this. We oppose socialism for the same reason we oppose putting out fire with gasoline. That stuff about us hating poor people and wanting them to die... that's just *rhetoric*. It's not *true*. Why do you guys always fall for your own propaganda? 

From a free market libertarian perspective, a poor person without a stable income is a tragedy, not just from their own perspective in the sense that they are suffering, but from the market's perspective in that here is a human being, with a sophisticated brain capable of producing great value, and no one has figured out how to unlock it. 

The sad truth is that most extreme poverty in the United States is not an economic problem at all. It is one or more of: a life skills problem, a mental health problem, or an addiction problem. These are real and urgent problems, but answers are not to be found in tampering with the market. 

> You've definitely helped me understand your aversion to government intervention. Given that - what's the solution? Can it be solved? Do you just tear it all down? How does any of this get better? Because it looks like it's all just getting worse on the current path.

When you get sick, one of the best ways to get better is to do less of what got you sick. Our healthcare system is sick because of state interference. We need less state interference. 

How does that work? 

Well, just as the internet interprets censorship as damage, and tries to route around it, free markets interpret state interference as damage, and tend to route around it. 

Right now, in the United States, there are two groups of doctors who have prescription privileges (yes, that's a sign of more state interference, but one problem at a time, eh?) who neither medicare nor private insurance will touch. 

These are naturopaths and osteopaths. If you read the Wikipedia articles on either one, you will read a tale of rampant quackery, because Wikipedia is almost always 100% right about math, physics, and engineering, and almost always 100% wrong about any politically controversial subject. 

They used to be quacks. The new generation of these guys has followed the research, and is unhampered by tradition or over-regulation. Because patients are paying out of pocket, they are not only free to practice medicine as they see fit, they are also *beholden to no one but their patients*. 

And what they are doing is practicing concierge medicine, charging anywhere from 2K to 5k+ a year to be available on an ongoing basis. They order lab tests, meet with their patients in person or over telecon, prescribe medicine, give advice. 

And **we know how to fix metabolic syndrome**. There's no single pill, but there is a plan. It goes like this:

* Monitor blood markers for the health of the heart, liver, kidneys, and provide some pharmaceutical support if needed.  
* Stop drinking soda, fruit juice or alcohol. 
* Cut out table sugar and processed starch ""foods"". 
* Enough with the bread already. 
* Eat lots of fat, protein, and fiber. 
* Stop eating small meals throughout the day, and eat a few big ones instead. 
* Intermittent fasting. 
* Blood test hormone levels (thyroid, testosterone, etc), and replace aggressively if they are low or midrange. 

But do you see what's missing there? There aren't any patented, high-ticket drugs. You can't ""invest"" in intermittent fasting. It benefits no one but the patient... and it sure as hell hurts the processed food industry. 

So the only way you're going to get doctors to prescribe this stuff is if the patients have total control... can hire and fire whatever doctor they want, for any reason they want.  If doctors are beholden only to patients, then and only then are they held responsible for producing results. 

And when does that happen? When patients write the checks, of course. The more we move away from that, the sicker people get. 

I don't know how things work in your country, or even what that country is, but I know how things work where I am. I have regular health insurance, but I don't use it, and will be useless to me unless I get in a car accident or something. The reason I have good health care is that I am paying somewhere around 6k a year out of pocket to have a guy on speed dial, and for all the lab tests and medicines I get through him. 

So what does that do for people who can't pay 6k a year? Absolutely nothing... yet. 

But the free market has lifted more people out of poverty than any other approach, and it does it by introducing things as luxury goods, then figuring out how to bring the price down. 

We're having to reinvent healthcare because the government fucked it up, and because we all then chose to double down on the expensive fuckup by shifting the cost around, instead of letting things be too expensive to afford, so that people would find ways to make them cheaper. 

*Preventive care costs the patient less than heart surgery.* Fasting is has a negative cost. Eating right costs something (because the state fucked up the food industry, too), but it costs a lot less than dialysis. Educating people about real food costs something, but it costs less than lipitor. 

The answer to this problem is the same as the answer to every problem humans have ever faced... let people to free to find answers. Free markets and technological advancement are, metaphorically speaking, the only gods worth worshiping, because they are the only ones than answer prayers and give us real blessings. 

And every time we disrespect them and start bowing down before the golden calf of socialism, or managed economies, we suffer for it, then foolishly blame our suffering on ""too much freedom"", instead of too little, and call for more regulation. 

The free market doesn't solve problems for us, but it does is offer billions of functioning brains the opportunity to have an idea and act on it... and all the other brains an opportunity to see that idea work, and imitate it.",Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.

That's a truism. There's always unintended consequences of everything. And every social movement forward has been met with these same tired arguments. Sure, there is a chance of making things worse by trying to fix an already broken system but thank God that has never been reason enough for people not to try. Cause if it was, slavery would still be a norm, women still wouldn't be able to vote, gay marriage would still be illegal in most places, I would be working in a factory 7 days a week...you get the point. When we get to those ""unintended consequences"" that come from reducing the ability of corporations to price gouge medicine people desperately need, or destroy Earth for the sake of their profits, we'd face them. Till then I would continue to face the consequences I can actually observe. 

> I also believe that governments are just as corrupt as corporations and are both equally good and bad.

What do we mean when we say a government is corrupt? Isn't that just a fancy way of saying government is working in the interests of powerful people? Isn't corruption simply wealthy/powerful individuals creating laws and systems that benefit them and make them more wealth (usually through bribing lawmakers)? Also one thing to keep in mind though is that at least with governments you have some power as a citizen to VOTE and make changes. What power do you have as a worker to make changes to your corporation? What power do you have as a consumer to hold a corp responsible when it has cornered 90% of the market? What power do you have as a consumer to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for raising prices of drugs people desperately need so they can make 1000% profits? Or should we just hope and pray for the magnanimous billionaire to rise up and help us out? That doesn't sound like freedom to me.

2690,"You don't want to stabilize insulin. 

Your body regulates metabolism via hormones circulated in the blood, not by nerve signals. Therefore a signal cannot go to one particular part of the body... only to either everywhere there is a receptor, or nowhere. 

Insulin stimulates cells to absorb glucose, which store as glycogen, or fat, or both, while glucagon stimulates cells to unpack and release that glucose. 

A cell cannot simultaneously absorb and release glucose... that makes no sense. It's either doing one or the other. If you never give your insulin levels a chance to go low, then you can never get the fat you stored back out of the cells. 

If you can't get the stored fat out, you can't burn it, because it's not stored in the muscle cells while it's needed, it's stored in adipose cells. This is why fat people are hungry all the time. Their adipose cells are full of energy, but their blood is starving, because they won't stop eating for a long enough period for glucagon to rise and insulin to fall. 

If you want to burn fat, you have to wait long enough between meals for the body to pull the fat out of cells. 

This is why calorie-restricted diets don't work, but intermittent fasting does. 

* Primitive people who couldn't store food, or access stored food easily, didn't get fat. 
* Pre-1970s people, who cooked and ate three solid meals a day, and nothing in between, didn't get fat. 
* Modern office workers who snack at their desks throughout the day, get fat. 

Calorie counting is a big lie. ""A calorie is a calorie"" is a big lie. ""Eat less, move more"" is a big lie. 

Maintaining a healthy body weight is not about how much you eat, it's about what you eat and when. When you are going to have a meal, avoid sugar and processed food, but eat as much as you want. 

Then wait a long time before eating again. 

**People are not fat because they are lazy and greedy. They are fat because they have been deceived about HOW to eat, and poisoned with toxic food.**

2895,"I recently did a access to information request on my police record. I have an arrest for “assault” from when I was 19 but it was a matter of self defence and I was never formally charged or convicted. Unfortunately, if I were to do an enhanced criminal record check, a potential employer can see any “negative interactions with police” and the burden is on me to explain the story, despite never being convicted and having no convictions whatsoever. 

I asked a cop if he thought it was unethical  and evasive that unproven allegations should show up on a police record check. His response was “just because you were never charged or convicted, that doesn’t mean you weren’t guilty. That could be true, but not necessarily either. 
Im actually willing to bet you that on a balance of things, more lives have been ruined by false allegations than lives that have been saved because police passed on information about someone who was in fact dangerous but never convicted of a crime.

So pick your poison, a few innocents convicted along with most criminals, or no innocents convicted and some criminals run free.

3304,"It takes victims a lifetime to heal from rape. Often, rape victims will spend more than 20 years, sometimes a whole lifetime healing (especially if it happened when they were children). Rape robs you of basic, good **beliefs** about the world and replaces them with lies created by the rapist and what they said and did, and by your own mind - to protect yourself.

People who have been raped are often betrayed, vilified, traumatized, violated, and conviced it was their fault. These things impact every aspect of their lives, especially the really important things like love relationships, sexual intimacy, and familial relationships. Often, the impact is so severe that rape victims will attempt suicide. All of this happening behind closed doors, in secret.

The impact of sexual abuse is very hard to describe only because it touches your whole life and some people don't even start facing it until 10 or more years after it has happened. This is often because sex abuse victims are in denial it happened, blaming themselves, or convinced that they can handle It or that no one Cares. Meanwhile, the distrust, anger, self hate, etc spreads across more and more of their life until they eventually *have* to ask for help.
 It then takes decades of focused healing with a therapist, family, and especially a spouse (sexual partner) to identify lies and replace them with the truth.

Like I said, sexual abuse is hard to describe and it's impact hard to quantify. But, 28 years is a just sentence and frankly unusual globally. Most rapists will never go to jail, their victims never see justice (but still have to go through decades of healing), and if a rapist does end up in jail it's for very light amounts of time, typically 5 years.","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

We go to court a couple times, and every time it's getting continued because they take forever to test the drugs.

Our case was last in the docket, and the guy before us was a lawyer being charged for hitting another car. He spoke for an entire hour. I was so tired by the end of all this that my lawyer finally got to me with his threats and estimates that they wouldn't offer the plea bargain again if I continue the case. So I took the plea offer. Additionally, the guy who OD'ed must have claimed that the car key and my wallet were his, because the cops say they don't have them in evidence to give them back to me.","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

How would you devise a better system and what percent fail rate would you deem acceptable?  
  
[Well it just so happens that the World Justice Project produces a Rule of Law Index which systematically breaks down the factors that define a good justice system. According to this study the USA doesn't rank top 5, it doesn't even rank top 15, it's ranked 18/113.](https://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/documents/RoLI_Final-Digital_0.pdf)  
  
>Say 99% of the time someone is convicted they are actually guilty. Well that sounds good right? But out of 2 million people in prison in this country right now that would mean 20,000 innocent people are in prison.  
  
According to Innocent Project and Law Professor Samuel Gross, the rate of wrongful convictions could be as low as 1% but more likely it's as high as 5%. That means that there could be as many as 100,000 not 20,000. That is an unacceptable amount. (Also, this is unrelated, but the number of convictions for drug offenses is roughly 200,000, of those 40,000 are marijuana related, which could soon be decriminalized at the federal level meaning the population of wrongly convicted would increase to 7%)  
  
>Can we devise a system that is better than 99% accuracy? I'd be surprised if one exists in this world.
It's easy to say ""someone should fix that"". It's another thing to actually do it.  
  
There are plenty of things we can do. First off lets get lawyers to go through previous cases to strike down absurd precedence so you don't up with places like Alabama where sexual assault/rape victims have to prove that they ""earnestly resisted"" their attacker before the accused can be tried. Secondly, we should look at having a panel of judges instead of one. Finally, we need to get at the root of the problem and repeal laws like 3 Strikes and mandatory minimums that take power away from judges. Judges ought to have the competency and authority to mandate appropriate sentencing, which in some cases means practicing leniency (a rare gift in today's time).  
  
Shrugging your shoulders and saying, ""It ain't perfect, but it's good enough. I don't know how we could fix it, so we shouldn't even try"" is lazy and more importantly it's damaging. We should never be complacent with something that has the potential to ruin lives if misused.

Yes it does. Ineffective assistance means the lawyer committed malpractice in the criminal context.

IAOC is not a defense. It is a means of raising an argument on appeal when your trial lawyer fucked up and didn't raise it/preserve it below, which would normally mean it is waived on appeal.

I don't know why you're attacking me either about my thinking. I haven't said this is my philosophy or if it's morally right or anything. Sorry if it ticks you off, but that's legitimately how it works. We minimize the amount of ways we can make mistakes while prioritizing getting guilty people behind bars.

However, we aren't so strict that we always require something like video evidence of a person committing a crime to convict them. This is because of my point. If we made it that strict, then sure no innocent people would be convicted, but think how many criminals would roam free. 

The fact our system requires the prosecution to provide evidence of someone being guilty is simply an example of the court trying to minimize the amount of mistakes they make. The philosophy is still that it's better to let a few innocent people go to jail than let a lot of guilty people go free.","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

3623,"Basically, yes.

So there was 3 people accused in this crime (a rape), him and two friends.  He and another one of the accused got public defenders.  The third's family had enough money to get him a couple paid attorneys.  The paid attorneys got the third guy off free and clear - the trial ended in a hung jury, 11-1 in favor of acquittal.  The prosecution dropped all charges instead of opting to try again, because it was clear they had no case.

Meanwhile, the public defenders called not one single witness, and presented no evidence (called the ""no defense"" defense).  That included the doctor who saw the girl after the alleged rape who refuted her claim, and a key witness (used by the paid attorneys) that testified the victim was lying about large portions of her story, and that she was socializing and smoking with them after the ""crime"".  This was really key, since the prosecution case rested entirely on the victim's testimony.

Both kids represented by the public defenders were convicted.  It was later ruled by the original trial judge that she would vacate their sentence since public defenders did such a poor job, but the appeals court said the judge didn't have the authority to make that call and revoked it.

My opinion based on my reading, it's entirely clear they did nothing wrong.  The victim lied repeatedly about key parts of her story, and there were lots of parts of her story that just made no sense at all.

3650,"The point the guy makes about how ineffective assistance doesn’t reflect poorly on a defense attorney is generally true because almost 90% of appeals include that.  Defendants also like to include the court screwed up, etc.  defendants literally throw every argument at the wall and see what sticks on appeal. 

The standard for IAOC is also really subjective standard. “But for the deficient performance the result of the proceedings would be different.”  

Usually the court finds that the lawyer wasn’t ineffective and it was part of trial strategy.  But defense lawyers get accused in appeals for ineffective assistance all the time by clients who are trying to find any reason to get their convictions over turned. 

Even when ineffective assistance of counsel is found it’s rarely ever because the lawyer was completely incompetent and negligent.  It’s usually something really technical that the trial lawyer missed because they were busy in trial/hearing. Whereas the appellate lawyer who combed through the transcripts was able to find an error that everyone missed, etc. Eg. advising your defendant on immigration consequences. I’ve seen where a Court found IAOC because defense counsel wasn’t “detailed enough” when he told his client about the immigration consequences. How the heck is anyone supposed to know they need to go that much detail to go into?  Again its a really subjective standard 

For those reasons, I️ really don’t think the point you bring up that ineffective assistance of counsel equals automatic criminal malpractice is true.  What usually happens is that the conviction gets reversed and set for retrial. But the attorney doesn’t get sued or sanctioned (usually).","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

However, that’s not the same as legal malpractice, nor is legal malpractice a criminal offense, it’s a negligence claim which is a civil claim.","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

However if you call no witnesses, but just cross examine the States witnesses, you can make the States witnesses look really bad and poke a ton of holes and create a ton of reasonable doubt in the States case without subjecting any of your witnesses to cross examination. 

So it’s really effective. 

Unless by no defense, you mean, not cross examining the States witnesses or putting on any of your witnesses. In that case, that’s just retarded.

3760,">The point the guy makes about how ineffective assistance doesn’t reflect poorly on a defense attorney is generally true because almost 90% of appeals include that.

1. We are talking about a successful IAOC claim, not the fact that an argument has been made which may or may not have any merit.
2. I have read a lot of appellate cases, both published and unpublished, and I dispute your claim that 90% of appeals include it. It is nowhere near that high. The issue is litigated in only a smallish fraction of appeals I have read.

>Defendants also like to include the court screwed up, etc. defendants literally throw every argument at the wall and see what sticks on appeal. 

That might happen in some cases, but in my experience the opposite is true: defendants are usually represented by appointed counsel who fail to raise every arguable issue, and frequently claim there are no issues at all.

>The standard for IAOC is also really subjective standard. “But for the deficient performance the result of the proceedings would be different.” 

It's more complicated than that, but it might vary by jurisdiction. Still, IAOC is almost always denied in all jurisdictions, because the reversal rate for criminal appeals is laughably low, like below 5%.

>Usually the court finds that the lawyer wasn’t ineffective and it was part of trial strategy.

More like ""sure he was ineffective, but it was strategic and we aren't going to second-guess his strategy"". The OP case was clearly strategic, and under California cases he would not have won his appeal. 

>Even when ineffective assistance of counsel is found it’s rarely ever because the lawyer was completely incompetent and negligent.

I disagree. I would say it is rare that IAOC happens where the lawyer was NOT negligent, such as a technical reason like failure to advise, which could still be negligence depending on the circumstances.

>It’s usually something really technical that the trial lawyer missed because they were busy in trial/hearing.

lol, try that excuse if you fuck up a civil case and see what happens.

criminal defense lawyers can be sloppy as hell, and they get a pass.

>Eg. advising your defendant on immigration consequences.

If you convince your client to plead guilty, and he only accepts because you didn't tell him he would get deported, that's pretty negligent. You fucked your client into a deportation without giving him a chance to either fight the case or negotiate a non-deportable disposition, all because you were too incompetent or lazy to address an issue that comes up all the time.

>I’ve seen where a Court found IAOC because defense counsel wasn’t “detailed enough” when he told his client about the immigration consequences. How the heck is anyone supposed to know they need to go that much detail to go into?

Getting deported as a consequence of a plea is serious shit. I love how you don't take it seriously. In my county in California, all it takes is a very short advisement saying ""if you are not a citizen, you will be deported as a consequence of this plea"". The end. It's not rocket surgery. 

>I️ really don’t think the point you bring up that ineffective assistance of counsel equals automatic criminal malpractice is true.

I never said automatic, but because IAOC is so rarely upheld as a basis for reversal, it is safe to say that the lawyer responsible probably fucked up bigtime. In THEORY IAOC could be granted for petty shit, but in PRACTICE it is so hard to convince the appellate court to reverse on IAOC, that if you win on that issue, yes it would reflect very poorly on trial counsel. 

As someone who drafts appeals sometimes, including criminal appeals, I have to shake my head at how sloppy most criminal trial counsel are. I can tell you that nobody would put up with that shit on the civil side. Watch how fast your get sued if you blow a big case for some corporation. I saw a lawyer get hit for a 7 figure malpractice case because he failed to ask a follow-up question at a deposition. Meanwhile criminal defense attorneys get away with murder because nobody cares about criminals or their rights, really.

Just for laughs, I did 2 searches on California case law:

- ""ineffective assistance of counsel"" = [11,900 results](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=4%2C5&q=%22ineffective+assistance+of+counsel%22&btnG=)

People v. Wende is a case that generally only gets cited when an appointed appellate lawyer says the appeal is frivolous, so then the defendant gets a chance to file his own brief, and even if he doesn't, the appellate court is supposed to do its own review. I'm not aware of the court ever reversing once Wende gets invoked. So Wende citations are a good shorthand for ""cases flagged as bullshit and shit-canned without any real consideration of the merits"". 

So my little search comparison shows that there are a lot more of these cases, vs cases where IAOC ever gets even mentioned at all. 

So I'm going to respectfully disagree with your opinion, at least as far as California is concerned. 

Plus, I'd point out that ""raising"" a claim is meaningless, actually winning on it is what matters here. ","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned. Becomes a lawyer and is now helping overturn other false convictions."

>So if say a lawyer just doesn’t bring up an argument, but never indicates why, then it’s a decent IAOC claim. 

Not in California, since the appellate courts assume that defense counsel doesn't do things as part of a litigation strategy unless it is really egregious or irrational.

The main reason IAOC gets used on appeal is when you want to raise a waived argument, and say ""if you consider this argument to have been waived or not preserved below, then it was IAOC to not raise/preserve it"". Then the court is stuck considering the merits of the argument to consider the IAOC anyway.

>nor is legal malpractice a criminal offense, it’s a negligence claim which is a civil claim.

Thank you Captain Obvious, I never claimed malpractice was a crime. Actually, I was quite clear it wasn't. I said ""in the criminal context"" which obviously meant ""in the context of a criminal case"" not ""in the form of a crime"" which is an irrational interpretation from you.

>However, that’s not the same as legal malpractice

If a person wins on IAOC, his lawyer committed malpractice. The court of appeal going so far as to reverse a case because of a lawyer's fuck up, means that lawyer failed to meet the standard of care. Good luck trying to defend a malpractice suit after being pegged as the reason your client didn't get a fair trial.

3764,"What are you talking about? If a lawyer is negligent, a malpractice claim can be made. The three most common malpractice suits result from alleged professional negligence (breach of duty of care), breach of fiduciary duty (not acting in best interests of client), and breach of contract (not doing what they would said they'd do). This is an empirical fact and why so many lawyers have malpractice insurance. I wonder why the courts haven't thrown out all of these malpractice lawsuits claiming negligence... hmmm... 

If you're correct, a lawyer can be professionally negligent, but not have committed malpractice.

3767,">1) your client might be stupid and say something he shouldn’t on his own, 2) your client may get eaten alive on cross examination, 3) any witness you call May say something they shouldn’t or may get torn apart on cross. 

This is why civil lawyers do client prep, but criminal defense lawyers are too lazy and ain't got time fo that. 

For people who don't know, client prep means going over their testimony, and hitting them with likely cross examination questions, and then going over their responses with them. Think of it like how presidential candidates do debate prep.

The only reason that you don't put a witness on the stand is if you have attempted to prepare them, and come to realize they are hopelessly terrible and beyond your help, and/or are actually lying.

Not putting the defendant on the stand is a totally different issue because juries are petty little bastards and if the defendant comes across as unlikable in any way, you might need to keep him off the stand out of fear the jury will vote with their hearts and not their minds. Plus, if all he is going to do is get up there and say ""I didn't do it"", that's not very helpful.

>However if you call no witnesses, but just cross examine the States witnesses, you can make the States witnesses look really bad and poke a ton of holes and create a ton of reasonable doubt in the States case without subjecting any of your witnesses to cross examination. 

Sounds good in theory, but in practice (1) in my opinion juries convict people when there is obviously reasonable doubt all the time, because many juries are like ""I think he did it"". the end. (2) juries have weird interpretations of evidence and the legal standard, so they might just pile up a bunch of weak evidence, see nothing on the other side, and decide guilty even though technically legally they shouldn't. (3) juries punish people for ""looking guilty"" by hiding from cross-examination, even if they aren't supposed to.","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

 The show I've watched with a life long prisoner who was buff as shit was, he would work in the kitchen, and with the money he had from before/gifted/family and the buck a day from work he would buy massive canteen food (candy, snacks, random items).
This is garbage for working out obviously, so what he would do is trade his canteen food for peoples meals. Since prisoners hate the cafeteria food most of the time anways there was always a trade to be made. It was easy for him to slam like 3 or 4 trays every meal

3850,"Of course, I'm not saying it's justified for them to be in prison when they did nothing. I'm saying that a lot of the time I wouldn't say it's due to a flaw in our systems design though. I would say it's a flaw in our ability to judge a situation we were not there to witness. To get around that flaw we have two choices, make the criteria to convict someone so strict that it's impossible for anyone innocent to be imprisoned (which will allow a lot of guilty people to walk free), or we make the criteria loose enough that we are able to convict almost all criminals, but with the risk of accidentally convicting innocents as well.

My point is it's currently impossible to avoid accidents like this in any legal system unless you are willing to let a lot of guilty people walk away as well.

I recognize our system has a lot of things that are in favor of the defendant, however those are our current attempts at minimizing these accidents. All in all, our system is more leaning towards being loose enough to make sure most criminals get convicted at this cost. Think about it, if that wasn't the philosophy why aren't our criteria for evidence to prove someone guilty much higher so these things don't happen? It's because if we did that a lot of obviously guilty people would be set free due to lack of evidence meeting that criteria. So, in the end, we set the bar low enough to catch most criminals.

Nope. Malpractice is just a civil suit, so standard of care + preponderance. I've litigated them before. Have you? Nope.

Winning IAOC on appeal is a herculaen task. Only about 5% of criminal appeals win at all. Courts of appeal bend over backwards to make excuses to throw out IAOC. If you manage to be one of the lucky few to win and reverse on IAOC, it's a safe bet your lawyer fucked up bigtime. 

>Ill be waiting, breath held, for those cases or even statutes to prove your point. Should be easy for an appellate lawyer, hell you should have been able to cite them from memory.

1. If you knew anything about being a lawyer, let alone an appellate lawyer, you'd know that no one cites anything from memory unless it is the type of case that gets cited constantly. A typical appellate brief might have 50+ cases in it.

2. I'm not going to invest my time doing legal research to educate you when you can't bring the heat at all to begin with.

Some prisons and jails actually do try to rehabilitate their inamtes, the wardens actually see the problem and care.

Worth mentioning its 3 years conscription :(

I think the saddest part was always meeting poor ppl with sick parents/no family that would choose fighter role (which means also way less time at home) just to bring in some money home, minimum wage for civilians is 4500~ btw (1280~$)

3978,"So to sum it up in a not short way: 
Basically got drug possession/parephenalia charge while on probation for a stupid simple assault. So violated that probation, and got probation for the other charges. Well, I was a hardcore opiate addict at the time and continued to use and got caught, so 3 more violations. So I had to do all 3 probation sentences in prison, luckily they all ran concurrent so only had 18 months. 

So really I could've gotten 18 months followed by 12 months followed by 12 months more but the judge was relatively lenient given my circumstances. He said he doesn't like sending people to jail for failed drug tests in the first place but since I was on county parole that got aggregated he couldn't do much.  He brought that up because a few months prior the state passed a bill that stopped sending state parolees back to prison for just failing drug tests or not paying court costs. Technical violations. They realized it doesn't make sense and costs taxpayers a lot. But some counties like my own continue to do so but again, it's just another industry. They still send people to jail and prison for tech violations but if you're lucky and an addict you can shoot for treatment. My county has contracts with rehabs and treatment centers so now they just send you to a locked rehab and tax payers foot the bill. They send these young guys to jail for petty shit and they come out professional criminals. I mean they just got done rooming and boarding with felons for stealing an iPod from Walmart.

3980,"More prison fun facts, lol. Money on your books can be deposited by anyone. Money on your books can also be sent out and the department of corrections prints a business check to the person of your choice.

In jail money is what you buy on commissary. $3 toothpaste isn't just $3 toothpaste, that's actually $3 prison currency. So all your basic debts get paid in items usually. 

Now for larger transactions an inmate might call someone and say drop money on this other inmates books, if he owes the person and they want to do it that way. For example, *(hypothetically)* if I bought half a gram of some weed when I was locked up. It was $30 and I planned on getting more so instead of giving him items as cash I just called my cousin and said put money on so and sos account. Then I'd release a check to my cousin to pay him back within 3 weeks. Sometimes cash will get snuck in but actual cash isn't that common, but happens. Also guards will help with getting money in or out. 

There's people that specialize in loaning stuff, they basically have their own commissary store. If you're low on money or waiting for money they'll loan you whatever on credit and charge you interest also. So say if you get 2 candy bars loaned, you'd have to give him 3 back. People almost always pay debts, can't really run.

There's number of ways, honestly. I mean you gotta have different ways or you get caught. You have people in there that have been making thousands a month for years off football pools alone. So the people involved in drugs and other contraband like phones are making 2-3x that amount. People do everything from tattoos, selling homemade handcuff keys and weapons, drugs, phones, protection, etc. Nothing is free in prison and if there's a demand, it'll be there.","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

Unrelated but the prison guards in my county get paid pretty good what equates to $22-$30/hour. Although $22 isnt bad for a high school graduate. My friend's sister works there and so does her dad. The Dad makes $30 and gets a nice pension when he retires in a year or two.

These are analysed and she did it in such a perfect way they don't look self inflicted at all. Then she gives a description of her rapist.

Once the unions force a benefit, even if it's technically supposed to be ""temporary"", people don't want to give up this benefit because it's something they feel they deserve.

>the above shows that crime is inextricably linked to IQ and testosterone levels, which is inextricably linked to race.

That is you. Pretty douchey. Also, I'm going to kick you while you're down right now by pointing out that you are also wrong: in California, probation officers will absolutely violate for petty reasons, and it actually saves them work. The time it takes for them to write up the violation petition is minimal. A lot of these petitions are 1-2 pages and look like they took about 15 minutes of work. They rarely have to go to court to testify, because the vast majority, I'm sure well over 90%, and probably over 95%, of probation violators take a deal. So for that tiny amount of work, you get someone off your caseload for months, or maybe even permanently. 

I've actually seen a number of violation hearings, and many/most of them are very petty, although it can vary widely based on the personality of the officer and the caseload. Certain caseloads like gang or sex will violate if you look at them funny. Some officers will let multiple dirty tests slide, while others will violate you for a single dirty weed test even when doing so is legally questionable. 

I saw a guy fight a case while I was waiting for my matter to be called, where he fell and broke his GPS on accident, then called his PO and waited. The PO arrested him and they tried to revoke and impose sentence. The guy was in jail for almost 2 months even though he did absolutely nothing wrong. He won his trial, and the DA's only argument was ""breaking a GPS is a strict liability crime and he should go to prison no matter what"" which of course is laughably unconstitutional and fucked up. He won and got reinstated, but he spent all that extra time in jail just because he was a sex offender, and the probation office will arrest any sex offender on the slightest excuse, no matter how perfect their conduct on probation is.

4151,"That's not even the beginning of it. Look what happened in Arizona last year, as clear as day. Arizona was trying to pass a medical marijuana bill and the company responsible for producing and distrubiting the super strong opiate; fentanyl paid $500,000 to fight the legislation. Fentanyl and other pharm opiates would lose money if marijuana was a viable option for pain management. You see it happening in Colorado, opiate abuse is down partly because of marijuana being easily accessible and legal.

When you start learning about pharm companies that produce opiates you realize all they care about is money. The family that got rich off the old Oxycontin created literally millions or opiate addicts under the guise that Oxy was a safer, less addictive alternative to morphine. Which is obviously bullshit. 

Actual Oxycontin nowadays is garbage to a person trying to abuse opiates. Oxycontin took the US by storm because you could easily crush and snort or smoke these pills. Giving them a much stronger effect than intended. Oxycontin was literally the suburban housewife craze in the early 2000s. 

Fast forward to 2008, after years of ridicule the owners of Oxycontin finally change the formula to make the pill less abusable. The new OP Oxycontins couldn't be crushed at all, and if you grinded it down and tried snorting it would gel up. The new 60mg OP Oxycontins had about the same effect as 20mg of the old formula Oxy.

When they made that switch they lost upwards of 80% of their customers and revenue in their first year after the change. While it was mainly a good thing this left a lot of people with an opiate tolerance that couldnt be managed by the current pills. To this day people rarely ever take actual brand Oxycontin recreationally, people much prefer the generic oxycodone hcl (Roxicodone) and the price difference reflects such.

There are so many benefits involved in being in a union that, really, if you aren't in a union there's probably something wrong with you.

Women also don't have to serve, so they could spend their time getting a good nest egg for a much shorter work day if they didn't go to university straight after high school (or if they went and only worked weekends, which was fairly common too). Not only do they potentially get into working life a year earlier, but they can start investing for the long term much faster. On the other hand, if you land a good job in the military, the experience can actually be helpful, so if you're lucky it evens out.

Of course, it's different for someone who lives on their own, and being a clerk at a store is by no means the most attractive job around. You are also right in that living expenses are covered in the military. I feel it's fairly reasonable/understandable to compare oneself to peers, but maybe I should have been more specific in my post. In all of the three cases I had in mind (prison, conscription, weekend job while living with parents), prison seems least attractive and the grocery store seems to be the most, and they appear to be at least somewhat comparable.

The primary reason I switched off a standard bodybuilding diet  to a ketogenic one (about 9 months ago) was for the vastly more efficient eating schedule. I can do a 17-18 hour fast and then cram in all my calories in a 7-6 hour window at the end of the day. It's easier to get that many calories in when I'm eating calorie dense (but not volume dense) foods like full fat ground beef and putting grass fed butter on everything. I find that eating window works best with my schedule, I feel mentally clear all day because I'm not constantly digesting food every 3 hours, and I'm getting leaner than I ever have been. 

For the first 8 years of my lifting career I followed the standard BB protocol of eating every 2 hours and Tupperwaring shit around with me.

These algorithms look at things like age, education, the alleged crime committed, and where that person is from. Now none of those are anything close to racism on the surface, right? Right. They aren’t. But looking at the “where that person is from” is *incredibly highly correlated* with race. Like r^2 =0.9 in some places.

It is undeniable that the US is quite segregated racially in terms of neighborhoods. Whether or not that’s a problem or even due to racism is another story, and it isn’t relevant to the point I’m making. But given that this algorithm looks at a number of factors on a *correlation basis* rather than a *causal* one, in order to make its decision, it effectively uses race as a factor to make its decision.

This shows that structural racism doesn’t even need a racist anywhere. I’m not calling for white people to be crucified. I’m calling for responsible policy and evaluations of institutions that perpetuate systemic racism. It's not a conspiracy. A lot of it is unintentional and the fault of neither white nor black people, but that doesn't mean it can't be helped.","Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned.

4263,"Yeah that's what I was getting at when I said it, just as you said that's kinda what we come to know private prisons as. Contract and subsidy based inmate warehousing that's owned and operated by someone other than the government. And it is basically just warehousing, these prisons are there to make profit and rehabilitation is more expensive than just warehousing them and doing nothing. And plus, if they did rehabilitate the inamtes they'd still lose money because less people would come back theoretically. They have no reason to rehabilitate these people because they want criminals to stay criminals, because bottom line is they get paid money for each person they house. Like how the county prison near me took inmates from the tristate area and federal prisons to make more money. They'll keep taking in inmates even though it's already crowded. Both gyms they had were made into large dorms for low security inmates. 

I don't know how this isn't illegal but at one point most 2 person cells had 3 people in it. And these are 12ftx6ft cells or so, not big at all. And you're in locked in hours at a time. The last guy to come in the cell would have his mattress  on the floor to sleep on. A cell with 2 guys gets crazy forget 3 people.

These are people that don't have any history of mental illness and go the seg and just lose it mentally. 

We banned solitary confinement in the late 1800s/early 1900s because we found out it was ineffective and caused people to go insane. Fast forward to the 70s, the start of the drug war and the closing of mental hospitals across the US boosts prison population and all of a sudden solitary confinement is back and were using it more than ever.

Plus, even if a pedophile is in for molesting an 8-year-old boy do you really think they they don't think about those 13-15 year old young boys because they're locked up and prefer 8 year olds? No, some of those guys would absolutely have sex with one of those boys if they knew they could get away with it. And I guarantee more than one of them would think about it daily. You can not, not think about it if that's the only ""guys"" you see all day and if you're attracted to children.

The inmates arent exactly having a council meeting before they stab him. They don't care how old the victim was, you have sex crimes against a minor therefore you're labeled a pedophile.

4269,"That's why I'm kinda opposed to the death penalty.

Nobody should ever get the death penalty unless there is 100% proof they're guilty, and a lot of the time all the proof isn't given but a guilty verdict is handed down. You can't give someone death if you aren't absolutely sure. Even if you're 99.99% sure, that .01% should be enough to not consider the death penalty. 

Even if that guy gets exonerated you fucked up his life forever. God knows how he was affected mentally.

Time Magazine did a great issue on the death penalty back in Summer of 2015. How we do the death penalty in the US currently costs taxpayers more money to give the death penalty than it does to house the inmate for life. Which is shocking because everyone thinks the opposite. But when you factor in all the appeals, hearings, lawyer costs, the salary of people involved, etc. it is more costly.

4272,"I had the same issues man, I have major anxiety and depression and it was not fun or easy at first while I was locked up. The first time I was in county jail until court was prettt ""traumatic"". I was withdrawing from opiates and Benzos, didn't have my meds or anything. After that time in county, when getting out my use sky rocketed. I met new dealers, found cheaper drugs, etc. I couldn't smoke pot anymore because of the drug tests and thats unfortunately how I self medicated my mental ailments. So I just did opiates and avoided testing or cheated tests. And drug use like opiates only makes your mental illness 10x worse, and it doesn't stop once you get clean.

Im not going to lie, I got high and  drunk several times when I was locked up. Again just another way to pass time. If I wasn't careful I could've left prison with a heroin habit. I actually didn't get clean until I came home and got off all parole and probation. So I finally quit after like 5 years when I wasn't forced too. I could've went back to using since I didn't get tested for the first time in years. I was just finally truly tired of opiates, Everytime I got high I just felt guilty and depressed, like I didn't enjoy it and it felt dirty almost.

**Point is;** He won't quit until he's ready, but that doesnt mean he shouldn't try. But little steps, if he couldn't get clean cold turkey start looking into methadone or Suboxone. Sometimes that route is much better over hoping he stays clean and doesn't die from an overdose. Reality is relapse rate is high, it's not easy.

4374,"For those of you saying ""fund this!"", I can assure you that there's a TON of stem cell research and clinical trials going on. They're not a magic bullet yet, but some research is very promising. I can give you an example from my own experience:  five years ago my wife suffered a stroke (at age 43), leaving her with very limited mobility on one side, along with some cognitive deficiencies. A little over a year ago she was accepted into phase 2 of a clinical trial, where genetically modified stem cells were injected directly into the brains of patients who were several years post-stroke (brains were imaged in great detail and injections were made around the area of damage). No results are available yet from this phase, but in the very small phase 1 of the study several patients had dramatic improvement (one was able to raise her arm above her head the next day, when before treatment she could barely move it at all). That being said, some patients in the first phase had minimal to no improvement, and my wife has not had any response from her treatment, which was over a year ago now.  From what I've been able to learn about clinical trials in this time, if the treatment in this story (which I believe is from 2016) had this dramatic result for a statistically significant number of participants, it would have been fast tracked and been more widely available by now.  There's a lot of money to be made in this, since pharma companies will be developing the lines of stem cells that will be used, so once something is proven safe and effective you can bet that it will be made available.  My wife's study was pharma (not government)  funded, although the study PIs are university based. As for our own situation, we're now anxiously waiting for word  on what study group my wife was in - there were two different dosages of stem cells, and one control group (the control group got a ""sham surgery"" - they really drilled into the skull, but not all the way, and then just pretended to inject the cells). 52 patients in each group.

“Will this ever help me or someone I love who has a spinal cord injury?

The answer is, not directly. If you read the fine print at the Asterias website, one question that pops out is who exactly is a candidate for their study. The answer? People with injuries that are between two and six weeks old. This is the range they’re calling “sub-acute,” and the reason for that particular restriction is that when those scientists back in California tried putting their cells into rats with longer-term injuries (usually called “chronic SCI”), the rats didn’t get better. Some of them actually got worse.”

it actually doesn't matter, non embryonic stem cells are easier to access and more useful so they get more funding anyways.

>Federal funding of human stem cell research appears to follow the latter  pattern.   Restrictions on funding hESCR were lifted in 2009, giving  the federal government the opportunity to dramatically shift resources  and give hESCR a proportionately larger share of funding than human  non-embryonic stem cell research.  Fortunately, it did not.  Funding for  hESCR research – even with restrictions lifted – has consistently and  considerably trailed funding for human non-embryonic stem cell research.

They are not derived from eggs fertilized in a woman's body.

This is part of a very long trend of stem cell research that is actually not totally full of shit. It started in the 90s with injections into rat cerobrospinal fluid after artificial injuries.

There are doctors studying these who seem to have much more measured assumptions, and are not treating it as magic, like hundreds of stem cell clinics would have you believe.

Specifically, the goal here is not to regrow a severed spinal cord, but to alter the cerebrospinal environment in the immediate aftermath of injury to cajole neurons into healing and reextending their axons. In a way this is similar to a variety of experiments injecting other junk into rat spines and seeing how it affects healing.

Honestly, it's refreshing to me, to see that yeah, some doctors are actually approaching this in a way that doesn't scream ""scam"".

5388,"Stem cells are the type of cells that still replicate often and that haven't completely specialized to perform a specific role (such as secreting stomach acid).
The general idea is that you inject these stem cells wherever they're needed. They get cues from their environment telling them what kind of specialization they should start to develop. Then, they divide into a new, and hopefully healthy, tissue.

I've even heard they're even experimenting with growing a 'donor organ' from your own stem cells. They'd take something like a pig's heart, then remove all cells, leaving only the scaffolding for cells behind. Then, they'd extract some stem cells from you and inject them in the scaffolding. Your own cells would then grow into a functional heart that can replace your faulty heart. Since it's made from your own cells, the 'donor' organ won't be rejected. (I'll see if I can find a video on the subject) 

Of course, reality isn't as beautiful as theory. It's more complicated and nuanced than what I'm telling. The world of microbiology really is a magical place though.

5466,"Never say never! My boss (smartest human I’ve ever met) loves to talk about the acceleration of technology and how using Moore’s Law for every technology sector is a really good basis. 

For those that don’t know, Moore’s law (when applied to its original field) is that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years. Effectively meaning that processing power doubles every two years. (This has slowed down recently but again this is just a generalization). 

Applying that to all technology and specially cost, imagine this treatment costs $100,000 (just a made up number that helps keep numbers easy to understand). Now if technology doubles (costs halve) every two years, that means every 5 cycles or 10 years we get a ten-fold improvement also known as an order of magnitude.

So applying that to our example, in just 10 years that same treatment will now be $10,000. Still very expensive but much more manageable. Then think another 10 years. Now we’re at $1,000. Almost everyone will experience a $1,000 medical issue in their life. Now another 10 years, it’s $100 and you don’t even bat an eye.

So in 30 years you went from one-of-a-kind groundbreaking procedure to a completely normal operation that people could go to their doctors office for an hour check up and get.

Of course this is all theoretical and won’t apply to some areas of technology and stuff but I think it’s a pretty good approximate for how things are going.

The whole point is just imagine what things will be like in 50 years or 5 orders of magnitude different then where we are now. In the above example that same treatment that once was $100,000 is now $1.

As a disabled and chronically ill person currently fighting insurance for necessary medical equipment, it’s important to remember that. New technology is incredibly exciting and uplifting, but it’s often more inspiring to able bodied people reading about it than to the people it’s meant to help. Many disabled folks are not able to work or work as much is needed to support themselves, or are working but can’t afford medical costs. I’m 21, too disabled to work any job I’m qualified for, and I have $500-$600 in co-pays for meds and doctor’s appts every month. If I didn’t have insurance, I’d be screwed.

Culturing stem cells is not like growing some bacteria. You need highly sterile work environment, a supply of high quality medium, specicialist equipment and a lot of experience to keep the cells alive and then you have not even begun to extract stem cells, that is just the stuff you need for regular old cell culture.

In order to 'make your own stem cells' you will have to extract whatever cells you want to start with, which might require anesthesia or at least non-trivial medical procedures.

You would then need some method of cell sorting in order to extract the relevant cells, the specialist knowledge to even identify them and then you still might have to take several complex steps to even induce pluripentency.

If you somehow manage to do all that and you then 'just inject where it hurts',  your best case scenario is that nothing much happens. Worst case ranges from severe infections to cancer.

6154,"As I said previously: cancer is not a contractible disease, it's something your body does. Furthermore, 'cancer' is a collective term for hundreds if not thousands of genetic disorders that lead to abnormally quick cell growth.

The cells in your eye rarely need to regenerate, whereas the lining of your stomach regrows every couple of days. Additionally, tissues need to grow at an increased rate after it's been damaged. 
In order for a cell to grow at the right rate, there are a larger number of regulatory mechanisms. 

For example, if a cell doesn't sense a neighbor anymore on one side, that means your body now has some hole that needs to be filled. That sensing is done by some protein which can give off a signal to trigger rapid when it's no longer connected to the next cell.
A random mutation could cause a cell to produce an abnormal version of this protein which constantly triggers the ""we need to regrow quickly to fill a gap""-signal.
This makes the cell grow slightly faster than it's neighbors... More cell divisions = more opportunities to develop more mutations. So the majority of tumors have developed a mutation in P53, a protein that regulates DNA repair... Which allows for mutations to build up even quicker, since nothing's being repaired now. Another common mutation is one that effectively makes the cell beg for new blood vessels to be made in its neighborhood = more available nutrients = even faster growth. 

Eventually, it gets to a point where so many mutations have accumulated and the cells are dividing so rapidly, that we call it cancer.

Now, to get to the part about telomeres:
Due to how DNA duplication works, in each cell cycle, a couple of base pairs (the 0's and 1's of your DNA) are lost. However, you wouldn't want the DNA encoding proteins to get lost as long as you live. So, at the end of each chromosome is a bunch of repetitive coding called the telomeres. It's just there as a buffer: before any important code gets lost, you'd first need to lose the entire length of your telomeres, which happens after X number of cell divisions. Now, I don't know the exact details (so don't quote me on this), but there is a protein called telomerase, which recognizes the end of the telomere and can add another couple of repetitions to make up for the loss. So, if a tumor produces extra telomerase, it can effectively increase the maximum number of cell divisions it has left before losing important 'data'.

It's been half an hour since I started writing this comment, so I'm not gonna flood you with even more info. I hope it cleared some things up. And you should of course feel free to ask more questions. ",First paralyzed human treated with stem cells has now regained his upper body movement.
6155,"See the thing is you can't just explain cancer because its not just one disease. There are thousands of different cancers that are very nuanced and so one treatment doesn't cure everything.

The general way cells become cancerous is by avoiding anoikis, a type of programmable cell death. Cancer that hasn't spread is usually easy to treat; surgery to remove the mass and chemotherapy to kill any stray cells. Its when cancer starts to move around the body (metastasis) that it becomes difficult. 	Occurs in sequential steps; Invasion of the extracellular membrane, intravasation, extravasation.


For metastasis to occur, cells must;

Activate oncogenic genes such as EGFR and HER2

Suppress/silence protective genes such as p53 and PTEN

Mutate or upregulate genes which are normally active

Avoid anoikis (a type of programmable cell death) which occurs when integrins detach

Degrade intracellular connections, tight junctions, adherens junctions, and gap junctions through epigenetic modifications


Initiate angiogenesis (the formation of blood vessels).

As to how cancer forms, the cells mess up and turn on oncogenic or cancerous genes (upregulation) or they turn off protective genes (downregulation). They can also mutate normal genes which then have different characteristics.

A common gene that is upregulated in cancer is EGFR. It belongs to the same family as Her2/Neu which is highly implicated in a lot of breast cancers. We've known EGFR acts as an oncogene for over 30 years now, and we know how to target it. So why not do that? Because EGFR is involved in the cell cycle, and is needed for cells to progress through the different stages. Cancer therapies are notoriously bad for targeting JUST cancer cells, so if we were to target EGFR with a therapy, we would be putting the body at a massive risk. If your cells can't go through the cell cycle that means you have no new cells generating and will die a hell of a lot sooner than the cancer will kill you.

Yeah, I know some exist, but I have to leave some stuff out of my comments for the sake of simplicity.

>see the protein signalling (mutated) causing cell growth,

Since most of this signaling happens inside the cell, the healthy stem cell wouldn't see this. One thing it could 'see' would be if the proteins that bind cells together would've become mutated. Then the stem cell's regular proteins would no longer be able to sense the deformed proteins. That would lead to increased growth.

We can, however, see when a baby is already dead- they die in the womb post-twenty weeks and pre-birth (including forty weeks, potentially), and in that situation, they would perform an abortion so that the mother doesn't have to go through the trauma of birth for a child that has already died.

6238,"Guyton and Hall Medical Physiology chapter 6, page 87 - when a muscle loses its nerve supply it immediately begins to atrophy, and after 1-2 years there is no capability of returning to function. In the final stage of denervation atrophy, most of the muscle fibers are destroyed and replaced by fibrous and fatty tissue. The fibers that do remain are composed of a long cell membrane with a lineup of muscle cell nuclei but with few or no contractile properties and little or no capability of regenerating myofibrils if a nerve does regrow. That fibrous tissue tends to continue shortening, which is called contracture and can be debilitating and disfiguring, which is why daily stretching is required during the atrophying process.

So, to summarize, even if we manage to find a way to repair spinal chord injuries, if the injury occured more than 1-2 years prior to therapy the therapy won't have much effect, unless we also find a way to reverse muscle cell metaplasia into fibrous and fat tissue.

There's something beautiful about resetting a body that was previously confused and attacking itself with its own cells.  

Obviously the biological and medical potential of embryonic stems cells is undeniable, however, they are controversial for ethical reasons. Those who might exhibit hesitance or outright oppose your mother's type of treatment  are likely not educated on how iPSCs are different.  Many religious and conservative (though not necessarily) individuals and groups oppose the use of embryonic stem cells because of their sourcing. While I have never met someone opposed to cells harvested from placental tissue, the issue arises when they are harvested from aborted fetuses. 

Those who hold this position believe that life starts at conception and that abortion is murder. Therefore, using their body is unethical despite their valuable stem cells going to waste. An opponent to the use of embryological stem cells would be more concerned with that person's entire life going to waste, including their stem cells which every developing human needs.

Regardless, you could argue that they are already terminated, so why not use them, then it becomes an issue of consent. If you believe that fetus has personal rights, they cannot consent to donating their organs or tissue, like an organ donor has the right to specify. 

Ultimately, it hinges on the personhood of an embryonic human. 

Others might argue that it is immoral to use technology like iPSCs which were made possible by previous embryological stem cell research which necessitated sourcing from aborted fetuses. Personally, whatever you believe, I think it would be a dishonor to those who were sacrificed, unwillingly or not, person or not, to discard techniques that could and are saving lives, especially as we begin to move away from the need for embryological stem cells sources from aborted fetuses.

How so? If the goal is to heal or regenerate certain tissue -- as noted in the article in question -- then there presumably exists some tissue that can only be generated using embryonic human stem cells (the only kind the anti-abortion types are concerned with, unless you can cite evidence to the contrary). So look for it -- do a search. Again, we're able to use monkey, and cow, and frog and other embryonic stem cells to determine where embryonic stem cells might have some inherent advantage, so stop pretending this is some unanswerable question.  

Or look at it this way. If there WERE some body part (be it on a monkey, dog, cow, frog) that could only be generated via embryonic cells, do you honestly think that a simple internet search would be unable to find it? You don't think that advocates of HEST research would be trumpeting that omission to the heavens as a way of justifying their research? 

>conflating scientific consensus with religious faith

The post clearly said ""faith based on science"". I'm not sure what that is, frankly, but even if it's not a religion, it's still based on faith, so the argument applies.

Again, provide some actual evidence for anything you're saying. You know, papers, and links -- anything other than your own preachy dogma. I mean, for someone so evidently antagonistic to religion, you seem to pretty comfortable with pontificating.  I've noted the [teratoma-EST issue elsewhere](https://www.nature.com/stemcells/2009/0903/090305/full/stemcells.2009.36.html). So far, there has not been one acknowledgement of that problem in a single reply -- I'm starting to suspect that there are people on this thread who don't even know what a teratoma is, and yet consider themselves to be qualified to assess to what extent the science would have advanced were it not for this or that. That's some serious Dunning-Kruger effect in action. 

To the extent there actually people here who want to do more than pontificate I could go on to cite the numerous other problematic issues aside from teratomas involved in research like this. For example, the recent New Yorker on the related topic of [mind/machine interactions](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/26/how-to-control-a-machine-with-your-brain) mentions, but for the most part neatly skips over what some of the monkeys had to go through in order to make results like this possible. Suffice to say, it ain't pretty, and you had better believe that there are some strict IRB restrictions on research like this, not just from religious folk, and while it may be holding the science back, it's also possible that they're not doing nearly enough. 

In short, there's plenty to be concerned about, and a fine line to tread, and you don't have to be an abortion-activist to say controls need to be put in place. This is just one more example of the whole we-would-all-be-flying-in-jetpacks-were-it-not-for-the-Galileo-Trial line of thinking, which Tim O'Neill referred to as [""THE STUPIDEST THING ON THE INTERNET EVER""](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.com/2009/10/gods-philosophers-how-medieval-world.html)",First paralyzed human treated with stem cells has now regained his upper body movement.

Sounds pretty familiar. 

> The Nazis banned all [trade unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union) that existed before their rise to power 

Republicans oppose unions too. 

> In the 1930s, world prices for raw materials (which constituted the bulk of German imports) were on the rise. At the same time, world prices for manufactured goods (Germany's chief exports) were falling. The result was that Germany found it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance of payments. A large trade deficit seemed almost inevitable. But Hitler found this prospect unacceptable. Germany began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency. 

Hello, can you say ""Tariffs?"" 

> But after the Nazis took power, industries were privatized en masse. Several banks, shipyards, railway lines, shipping lines, welfare organizations, and more were privatized.

I wasn’t clear here. I wasn’t saying that my killer would get them, rather they would go to whoever was next on the donor list.  

>	due to our culture and way of thinking that sperm + egg isn’t special

I don’t think this is the case even with pro-choicers.  Pro-choice is not pro-death. For us this is an issue of bodily autonomy. I don’t think there should be a law telling me what I or my wife can do with our bodies, and my wife feels the same way. Personally I would not choose to have an abortion if we were pregnant, but that is our choice to make not anyone else’s.  I highly doubt people have abortions specifically to harvest body parts. Is it possible?  Yes, anything is possible, but bad actors are more than likely an insignificant percentage of the total number of abortions performed yearly.  I’m talking minuscule.

>Why do you think that?

Because it is.  Look, I’m not saying everyone should just go get an abortion all willy nilly.  And *if* (big if) someone was getting pregnant and having abortions specifically to harvest fetal parts, then that is repugnant. The fact is mistakes happen, condoms break, teens are going to have unprotected sex. I’d rather them have the option of an abortion than a child be born into poverty or to parents that are ill-equipped to raise a child or to add to the foster/adoption population.

> I don't have any opinion on abortion other than I support a woman's right to choose what to do with her own body.

Yes, I get that you think that a woman has a right to get an abortion because she wants a son and not a daughter. I think that is morally reprehensible. I also understand that you strongly believe that the decision of whether a man has to pay 18 years of child support (and sometimes more) should be 100% up to the mother, not even a discussion necessary.

But we don’t rely on abortions to get them.  They come from the IVF “leftovers” that are not implanted.  So you could have a child *and* save a life.

Though the good new is that you don’t have to worry about that anymore.  Scientists are currently able to use the patient’s own stem cells to provide therapies to needing recipients. Yes, the moratorium on embryonic stem cells forced scientists to find another way; however, the science is now eight to ten years behind. What did we gain by preventing embryonic stem cell research during the last decade?  It is arguable that the methods currently in use would have arisen even if embryonic research had not been taboo.  Abortion is still legal. Donation of fetal tissues is legal.  The same number of abortions would have occurred.  Certainly the people who could have benefited from the research are no better off.  Hence, the moral outrage of embryonic stem cell research served no other purpose than to placate the unarticulated reasoning of those who opposed it.

Yes, exactly.  This is what I DON'T want to happen.  

This is why we didn't go down the IVF route...the ""leftovers"" are still alive.  They would be my children, I just wouldn't let them live.  They would be frozen in time, until I couldn't pay the freezer guy anymore, and then they would die.  I've had two children die.  I can't contribute to more of them dying.

I think maybe you are focusing on me being pro-life and thinking that means I am against abortion.  In reality, I am against abortion because I am pro-life.  I am against IVF because I am pro-life.  The ""leftover"", as you put it, is life.  The baby in the womb is life.  The baby that is born is life.  None of these things should be killed to harvest their stem cells.

Cuba, here you might have some foundation. Yeah, Cuba has state ownership of the MoP, and arguably a half decent democracy, how ever it doesn't align perfectly. Its also been subject to trade embargoes by the USA which at the time severely weakened its economy, with it being reliant on sugar cane trade at the time. 

Cuba has also seen some of the quickest progress of a third world nation in the world. Its literacy rates are on par with the first world now, same with child mortality rates.
