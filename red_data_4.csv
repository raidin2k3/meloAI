100,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Gotta love humanoid robots. Looks around, moves its head and hands fluidly and naturally, and then walks away like it shit its pants."
101,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Challenge for Gen 3: crack the egg and drop the insides into a bowl
102,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,It‚Äôs always interesting how complicated our ability to walk is to duplicate.
103,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"People: ""That the robot is too slow""

Same robot in five years running after them with an axe: üèÉüí®"
104,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,What amazes me the most is the fingers. I've never seen a robot move its fingers like that. Incredible!
105,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"you can tell that the only reason elon named this thing optimus is so that when the final version comes out he can call it ""optimus prime"""
106,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Background extras when you ask them to act normal
107,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,That ending was completely necessary.
108,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"It‚Äôs crazy see how hard it is to make something walk like a human. 
Our ability to walk is more impressive than we anticipated"
109,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Those arm+hand movements are so fluid and quick. The walking could use some work, but impressive for the time they've had to work on this."
110,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Impressive likeness! Walks just like a 70 year old brick layer
111,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"The day robots learn to WALK like humans, it's Terminator judgement day."

116,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The hand movements are impressive. I'm hoping some day soon we'll see prosthetics this fluid.
117,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The programed natural sway left to right and the subtle arm movement of the robot in the beginning was fantastic. Almost human like
118,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"People here might joke about the walking, but considering it had to be wheeled on stage not so long ago, the progress is incredible."
119,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,now they're gonna make disassembly drones
120,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever live to see how things are going thus far with technology. What a time to be alive can‚Äôt wait to tell the grand kids what the 90‚Äôs were like.
121,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"@1:36 - My main takeaway is that we'll be able to have our Tesla robots dance battle each other. Will program mine to say the Optimus Prime line from part 2: ""I'll take you ALL ON"""
122,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The progress they achieved in just one year is astonishingüò≤

126,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"The dexterity is impressive, it's shocking at how much progress happened so quickly."
127,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"While Optimus here is walking like it shit it‚Äôs pants, Boston Dynamics has robots doing fucking Kung Fu and Jackie Chan stunts."

129,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,It's creepy how fluid and humanlike these robots' arms are able to move.
130,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,That hand movement is crazy.
131,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This is way better than Boston Dynamics. Aside from the part that this robot moves around like it took a crap in it‚Äôs pants.
132,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"This is so insane, it looks like CGI, but it‚Äôs actually IRL!!"

136,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This is incredible. At first it all seemed so outlandish but I could easily see these being used in homes in even a few years if they keep improving at this rate. Amazing.
137,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Still walks like it just shat itself. Nevertheless, phenomenal progress!"
138,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Elon   : AI is far more dangerous than nukes.
Also Elon: Lets keep creating advanced humanoid robots."
139,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Holy, that was so awesome to see looking at its hands and arms and then it walking. So human-like.‚ù§"
140,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I am impressed that they kept the weight down to 121 lbs.   I am guessing that the power/weight ratio will depend on the task these machines are designed to perform.
141,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Pretty scary how smooth the hand gestures are :D well done
142,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,So much progress in a short amount of time! Let‚Äôs go!!!

147,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I'm a 100% disabled U. S. Army veteran, I really need one of these guys"
148,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Love the way these robots walk. Reminds me of my younger days when I was severely constipated.
149,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Meanwhile Atlas spider crawls across the celling looking for optimal takedown angle to rip off this things head.
150,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Wow! Those movements are becoming very smooth! Tesla is on point with these robot developments!
151,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I think it would be a huge improvement if Optimus 2 did not walk like ""The Big Guy"" with a load in his depends.  Even at a higher price I believe it will be worth it."
152,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Now just imagine where we will be in 10 years if progress like this keeps up, or even accelerates."
153,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,That walk is me at 2AM trying not to wake anyone up as I get water
154,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I remember when it was first introduced. It looked like a bot from the 90s lol. The progress they've made is remarkable.
155,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Massive respect to all the brilliant engineers working day and night to bring AI humanoid robots to reality! üôå Your hard work and dedication are truly inspiring.

Keep pushing forward ‚Äì we‚Äôre all cheering for you, and the world is waiting for your incredible innovation! üî•üí°ü§ñ"
156,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The fluidity of its motion is insane
157,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,At least the terminator doesn't walk very fast yet lol
158,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This is game changing I cannot wait to see what next year's progress brings
159,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"To fix its movement you need to do 2 things:

1. Separate processing units, sensors and circuit for the motion mechanism.

2. Dont program the motions, let it learn how to move like a baby/toddler by trial and error. Walk is essentially the art of continiuosly falling, from one foot to the other. Your leg doesnt purposely push to reach the floor. You lift it to position and let it fall into the next position, and simultaneously shift your bodyweight behind the motion.

Source: dude trust me. 

P.S. it makes sense to me...
P.P.S I think that's why the boston dynamics robots' movements look way more natural. They have mastered the art if falling.."
160,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This new version looks really cool. I love how they styled it. They are making fast progress.
161,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Pretty amazing progress. The fingers articulation is just phenomenal for only barely a year of work. That tactile sensing on the fingers are so cool too! Cant wait till the day it gets so affordable, anyone can have one in their home."
162,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I think Optimus is almost ready for daily tasks like to load a dishwasher/washing machine, unload them, fold clothes/sheets and clean the house. It just need to go up and down stairs and that's it. That's more than enough to have a SOLID product. 

That hand and finger movements are incredible, in less than 10 years it will be able to cook and wash dishes by hand. No need for jumps and acrobatics like Boston Dynamics, it needs to handle daily tasks first."
163,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,by far the dopest looking humanoid robot ive seen. Atlas 2 looks cool as well.
164,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I wanted to be a software engineer since I was 8 years old so I could recreate Commander Data from Star Trek. That was 30 years ago, and now I work on AI. For most my life, I didn't think I would live to see anything close to AGI or this level of robotics. This video brought me to tears. Well done Optimus team."
165,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I‚Äôm 67 yrs of age with arthritis & other health problems, however as I look into my future with my husband being of the same age, I can see great use for the future Optimus robot. There is much I could teach Optimus from general household tasks to shopping, helping my granddaughter with school work, playing with the dog to learning gardening, food growing etc. I‚Äôm sure many people would find Optimus extremely useful particularly if one has disabilities. In addition it would provide conversation & help prevent loneliness. So Mr Musk should you need an Australian to help integrate Optimus into a family household that most certainly will in the future require more help I am more than happy to assist. Regardless, when you are ready to sell to the public I would definitely be excited to purchase an Optimus as I see these robots being essential for continuing life within the home as people age. Love watching these videos and seeing Tesla‚Äôs progression in this exciting and extraordinary field. ‚ù§"
166,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I love the design. It looks like a spacesuit.
167,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The fact that it took so little time for them to get this far is amazing
168,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I heard Amazon is also going to be releasing one of these, too. It will be called the Optimus Prime."

most just rely on the gyroscope, implementing the hips into the walk cycle was smart."
184,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Wow, it's quite amazing to see how quick it's evolving. Well done! Huge achievement"
185,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,It‚Äôll never not amaze me how amazing it is that we can walk how we can and robots show us just how hard it actually is to walk upright on two legs.
186,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The fact these are upgraded annually leaves me thinking in 10 years robots like this will be everywhere... crazy time to be alive.
187,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Absolutely amazing work! The secret of the cheetah's speed is flexible back. So I think if you add spine mobility, walking speed and balance will become easier and faster. I mean, it's unlikely that you will be able to run like an Olympic champion with a stick tied to your back. You can just try it)... I know that designing is incredibly hard work so it is just an idea to help Optimus run into the future like Hermes. Cheers!"

196,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"To me robots like these remind me of how incredible humans are. The way we are able to walk, to use our hands and fingers is just insane when you see how freaking hard it is to replicate that. We are, to this day, not able to recreate a human body with all its abillities to even come close to the ""original"". it's absolutely stunning. compared to a real human even the most advanced robots look like toys for adults even tho they are serious tech. gotta love nature!"
197,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"The people designing and funding this need to watch ""I Robot"""
198,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Knowing Elon and the Teslabot team, this is remarkable in itself but they've got so much more already up their sleeve, ideas, concepts and new activities. The forefront of robotics and ai innovation is right here."

FSD right now is a 95% solution - which is impressive - but short of the 10 years worth of hype and promises.  What's crazy is that us early adopters, who bought into the hype and paid 10K or more for functionality that's 'coming soon', are now hearing that we'll need buy a new car with upgraded hardware to get full functionality!  The icing on the cake:  Unless you hit a special promotion - we will also have to pay another 10K for the FSD software when you buy that new car.

The kind of future Elon is selling is fundamentally a dystopian capitalistic hellscape of many robot cars congesting our streets, instead of actually improving the quality of life of everyone by building better  environments using public transport and enabling the walk- and bikeability of neighborhoods, instead of forcing everyone to pay a robot taxi to take them from unsustainable suburbs to their lifeless office park.
I and many other people don‚Äôt want this future, and actually don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs going to be technically possible at some point just because it‚Äôs cool."

607,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,Oh good! Finally a robot that can go snowboarding for me.
608,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,I think they‚Äôre preparing us to accept living around robots ü§ñ
609,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,"This is kinda hard to believe because all the robots body movements are exactly like human movements, so I think it's CG overlaid on a human riding the snowboard. But if it's real then we're in deep poop üí© üí© üí©. üòÆ"

611,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,"that‚Äôs some great cgi, seriously tho, the lighting and shadow work really sell it, it looks movie quality"
612,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,This CGI is better than a lot of Hollywood studios chuck out these days. They should have hired you to the 'The Flash' movie.
613,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,What is frightening is how close this is to reality.
614,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,"When bystanders didn't look at it , I knew it was fake , something like this would have bystanders gasping"

626,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,"At one part of the video where there are people in the background the fact that they are not staring at the robot is a heavy indicator of CGI. If I saw a robot with a snowboard preparing to ride it like a human, my eyes would stay glued to it."
627,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,I would be surprised if robots can't actually do this within 5 years.
628,dWMzUuMXhMg,Tesla Robot learns to Snowboard #ai,"Dude. Looks so good! Honestly, the only giveaway is the human tracking. The robots don‚Äôt stabilize the way we do. We make unnecessary movement and theirs is all algorithms."

The Robotaxi can transport up to two passengers. If the cost at some far time in the future will come down to 20 cents per mile, that means the cost per mile per passenger is 10 cents.

912,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,‚ÄúARE YOU SMARTER THAN HUMANS‚Ä¶ARE YOU SMARTER THAN HUMANS??‚Äù I think he answered his own question üòÇ
913,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,When the crowd asks it to dance I felt a hint of social pressure and remembered it is a robot. That's nuts.
914,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,I really love how the robot got back to a question having dealt with another issue. That was so cool.
915,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,It appears to me that the robot is connected to headphones and a microphone and someone is speaking in the robot's place
916,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,The nervous awkward friend after one sip of alcohol:
917,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Those people asking questions sound so annoying
918,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,People 100 years ago would think this is some witchcraft from a different planet
919,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,‚ÄúYOU HAVE 12 SECONDS TO COMPLY!!!‚Äù
920,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,The military are going to LOVE these.
921,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"The Optimus Bot replying to the question ""What's your favorite band?"" makes me think it was actually a human interfacing through the bot."
922,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"This has irobot written all over it. When that red light on his exterior turns on, runü§£ü§£"
923,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"It's literally just a dude off-site somewhere piloting an Android, nothing AI about this aside from the stabilization"
924,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,The people laughing at his hydraulic fluid joke before he delivered the punch line proves hes smarter than most humans lol
925,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"‚ÄúI have been working out, check out these guns‚Äù

928,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"""Humans communicating with its future mechanical overlords - circa 2024""

Some history log from 100 years in the future"
929,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"2:15 I loved when he was responding to every polite human like questions, but ignored the heckling sounding ""Are you smarter than humans? are you smarter than humans?"" after answering ""I am smart"" once...That's too good."
930,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,These are 100% being tele-operated by actual people.
931,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Wait till they start interacting with and developing technology üíÄ. That will be the singularity üíÄ üíÄ
932,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,The robots dance just like Elon üòÇ
933,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"""Can you dance to your favorite song?""

Sure thing. I'll....
ARE YOU SMARTER THAN HUMANS"
934,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,All the dorks in the crowd don't realise that they're just talking to some bloke over the phone üòÇ
935,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Imagine it‚Äôs someone using body tracking technology with a VR set to see around him.
936,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Random Indian in the crowd:
‚ÄúARE YOU SMARTER THAN HUMANS????‚Äù"
937,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,I am giving 98% that they are teleoperated.
938,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,2:16 That Bully Maguire dance really kills it.
939,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Definitely not the robot talking it‚Äôs clearly someone on a mic.
940,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Even if it's being controlled by a person it's CRAZY how smooth it is
941,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,The number of scientists and engineers who haven‚Äôt seen Terminator is truly astounding
942,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Am I the only one who feels this was controlled by someone remotely?
943,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Twist plot : behind there's the motion capture actor to move and answer human-like
944,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,These bots are being remotely operated as showcased by how Tesla is training these robots using a remote rig. It‚Äôs still pretty cool to see just how far they have come in terms of mobility and dexterity of the robots. It‚Äôs very impressive for just 2-3 years of development.
945,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,I wouldn't be surprised if there were a guy in a motion suit and a mic behind this.
946,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"I think someone is answering those questions remotely. Not that Tesla robots aren't smart, but with the way it thinks before answering questions is a give away. Bots can't think. If they can, it's trouble."
947,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,1:11 I‚Äôm a big fan of edm he uses a lot of electronics üòÆ
948,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"I think it's a person controlling it and speaking, but either way... it's amazing!"
949,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,at 2:00 that women voice and laugh is so annoying üòÖ
950,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Now where's the dude that using walkie-talkie built in that bot? ü§îü§£
951,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Its scary the robot acts just like my best friend before he passed.
952,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,N¬∞ 37 is actually pretty chill
953,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"2:40 ‚ÄúSmarty-pants smarty-pants, he has no pants‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
954,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Reminds me of the movie the ""Substrate"", 10 years from now you'll send your robot to work and you control it remotely with a motion suit, greate for factory workers, construction, customer service, fire fighter, etc...."
955,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Step back please sir. Sir, step back. STEP    BACK"
956,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Can you imagine with this incredible progress what they will look like in 30 years!
957,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,I believe the robots in the crowd were being teleoperated but that the robots dancing and the ones serving drinks / gift-packages were running autonomously. The voices do seem to be from a remote operator. It could also have been some kind of combination of the two.
958,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"So people don't believe the robot voice. Meanwhile ChatGPT AI can talk, flirt etc like a real person. You got girls and dudes falling for how genuine they sound."
959,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Daft Punk dusting off the suits ready to play for an audience of adoring bots.
960,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Why does it sound like someone‚Äôs sitting in a booth answering the questions ?
961,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,lol there is just a guy connected to the bot with a microphone and some way to make inputs for his body parts :D
962,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,How much it cost
963,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"At some point in the future, maybe 20 years from now, some human fighter somewhere will be firing at one of these in a post apocalyptic war."
964,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"I wish we could know 100% if this was (partly) teleoperated or not. But in any case, the body and movements are amazing. He's also really sleek looking. Great engineering and design work."
965,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,I have a question. What if you buy one of these & for some reason it needs to get repoed. Does it off you and walk out or just leave you one day?
966,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,I remember a robot asking me questions in 8th grade during a field trip and we all realized that some dude was behind a door with a microphone answering our questions.....
967,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Imagine its just some nerd in a van near by responding
968,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"The moment he asked ""sorry, what was that?"" to understand the question better was quite uncanny"
969,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,yeah someone's doing the talking live üòÇüòÇ
970,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,There is a phone or communication device inside that robot. An operator is speaking through it like a zoom call. No robot can talk like that or interact like that.
971,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Irobot is becoming more and more like real life, Might look like it's innocent now just wait till you're driving home and they attack you in a tunnel üòÇ"
972,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,1:16 It would be funny if he answered Grimes lol
973,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Whether it's remote controlled or autonomous, commenters should not compare a walking and dancing humanoid robot to a suit. One is cosplay, the other is mind blowing technology. This is remote controlled, but by the time this robot is ready to ship to the market, AI will be advanced enough to do this and more. Common sense tells that if this was AI, then Tesla would have made a bigger deal in the show about having the best multi-modal reasoning AI model in the world."
974,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"""AI IS QUITE A DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGY""

976,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,2:20 the left arm stopping suddenly makes me think this is animated as a special effect
977,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Someone needs to ask whether it's remote controlled.
978,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Poor humans didn‚Äôt know they will be eradicated and be extinct because of this robots üòÇ
979,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Would be really impressive if someone wasn't remotely speaking or controlling it
980,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,1:31 daft punk is amazing W dystopian robot
981,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"The longer you watch this, the more you can feel everyone forgetting its a robot because they're so convinced by its personality."
982,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"The beginning of the end of the human race, we are walking blindly into oblivion. We will look back at this clip in decades to come and think why did we let it happen."
983,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"did you noticed, he shaking his head when music playing in the background , vibing to the music, thats crazy"
984,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Did he just dodge answering if he‚Äôs smarter than humans?! 1:50
985,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Wizard of Oz situation going on here.
986,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Someone is literally using a VR and making all the movements working from home
987,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"3:20 he answered a charging question that was asked by another person some time prior, that‚Äôs amazing."
988,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Anyone else find this genuinely terrifying. Even if most of this is smoke and mirrors, the technilogical advancements we've had in the past 2 years has been insane"
989,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Life was good, while it lasted."
990,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Who ever thinking this is automated.... Its a real robot yes . But you can tell its being controlled by a person somewhere in a room. He can hear you and respond.. making you think its real ai... Hes controlling movements... Probably has sensor's on his hands and torso which copies it all to the machine... That is what i see right now.
991,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,There all friendly at first....
992,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,This is impressive!!
993,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Even if it is controlled by someone at HQ, still very impressive!"
994,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,Human being voice controlled clearly
995,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,He is so polite. He asked everyone to please back up ‚ù§
996,IG4wSOzQatE,Tesla Optimus Bot interacting with a crowd,"Even though somebody else is controlling it from a mo-cap rig, Im still pretty impressed with how smooth the movement is on the robot. There are some subtle nuances that really sell the natural movement"
