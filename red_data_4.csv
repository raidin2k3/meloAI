1,2cukB4_hDCI,Robots testing the Bulletproof #cybertruck,"Dude : ""Now give me back my gun""
Robot : ""give me your clothes your boots and your motorcycle"""
2,2cukB4_hDCI,Robots testing the Bulletproof #cybertruck,We’re only ten years away from Will Smith chasing a Tesla robot with a gun in the streets of Chicago.
3,2cukB4_hDCI,Robots testing the Bulletproof #cybertruck,"Guy: Nice job! I’ll take my gun back.
Robot: “I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.”"
4,2cukB4_hDCI,Robots testing the Bulletproof #cybertruck,"*10 seconds later*
Robot:""Now we have to chexk if the human is bulletproof"""

28,2cukB4_hDCI,Robots testing the Bulletproof #cybertruck,"For those that dont realise already, this is a combination of crisp cgi and practical effects. The cybertruck seems real but the firing of the gun and the movement of the robots gives it away. Amazing how far technology has come though."
29,2cukB4_hDCI,Robots testing the Bulletproof #cybertruck,"The most menacing part of this video is the robot exclaiming "" Im alive."""

101,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",This is the best conversation between two robots that I’ve ever witnessed.
102,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",I find most interviews with Elon incredibly frustrating. Just shallow questions that don’t really do the man’s mind justice. This was great. Good job Lex.
103,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",This was Elons best interview well done Lexicon
104,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",His source of strength? He’s a visionary there bud.. no offense but this man doesn’t think like the ordinary Joe ..He has a desire to change the world.. a truly gifted man I believe guided by a higher power to propel this world forward.
105,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Dare I say that this is easily Elon’s best interview by far. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that it’s Lex on the other side of the table. Lex, you are getting better & better at this too💪🏽"
106,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",Lex and Elon for two and a half hours. Dreams do come true!
107,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","I'm still waiting for Elon to conquer the universe so he can focus on less important things, like his own line of colognes called Elon's Musk."
108,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Thank you soooo much for the interview, Lex and Elon!!!! I am using this in my class of ""AI Seminar"" for my students💚💚💚💚"
109,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","I respect and appreciate Elons moments of pause to think and respond the way he wants, but damn there’s so many times I thought the podcast froze 🤣🤣🤣❤️"
110,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",Lex is the right person to be interviewing Elon.
111,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Ok Lex, we have something to watch today, thanks!"
112,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",This was 2:31:47 of pure enjoyment. 23147 thanks to you and Elon for this mind blowing interview
113,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Elon is such an extraordinarily busy person, so it means a lot for him to give 2.5 hours of his time to someone. It shows the level of respect that he has toward Lex -- respect that has been well earned."
114,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","I love how Lex gives Elon time to think before answering the question, and that Elon takes time to think before answering.

We need more of that."
115,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",With most other interviewers I feel that I've heard it all and I'm just listening to Elon say things he's said a 1000 times. Not with Lex. His questions really allowed Elon to go deeper and share his thoughts in ways that we would never hear from 99% of other interviews. Thank-you Lex. What a beautiful way to spend the first few hours after midnight on new years day (for me).
116,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",Catching the rocket with chopsticks actually worked haha
117,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Nothing is more sincere than a person taking time to ponder a question. It increases the probability that the answer will be useful…and mostly unique. Thanks Lex, thanks again Elon."
118,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",This is the most laid back and relaxed version of Elon I've seen on any podcast.
119,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Loved this interview. I was struck by Elon's advice for life, ""Try and be useful."" He went on to say that being useful was incredibly difficult. I believe being useful can be simply a state of mind. My daughter manages an AM/PM selling junk food and gasoline. But she is so important for so many people just going through their day. To some many people, filling their tank on the way to work and grabbing a quick cup of coffee and some donuts is such a vital part of their day. My daughter keeps a very clean well stocked store and she is polite and cheerful to everyone she meets. She actually attracts repeat customers. How do I know? Customers have told her so. She is, in short, useful. We all have purpose if we look for it"
120,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",My 2 favorite minds on one video. I wish I could articulate my thoughts as well as you two! I would put myself out there working towards soooooo many causes!!! I respect the hell out of Elon and Lex for furthering humanities reach into new and exciting directions!!!! We can't survive without men like this steering us into a new world beyond our current abilities to perceive...kudos to you both.
121,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",Elon musk is appearing on the pod almost as often as Michael Malice does! Getting my popcorn ready this one is a banger!
122,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",I loved how Lex let the interview breathe. The moments of silence (where I had to check to see if the video was buffering or stopped) actually added gravitas to the question and subsequent thoughtful response. It was like Elon was playing out all of the probabilities of his responses before answering. Amazing to watch (and listen!) Way better than the WSJ interview… Keep up the great work!
123,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",Elon is in a great mood in this. Love to see him this way.
124,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",The Terminator and the T 1000 having a conversation.....amazing.
125,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",He seems to open up to you a lot more. Probably because you give him time to think a question through before answering and you don't ask typical stupid questions. Great job man.
126,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",I recognize and appreciate how comfortable Elon is on here. Doing Gods work Lex
127,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Let's just take a moment to appreciate the wonderful life of opportunities we live today.
I am sitting near the chimney in a 500 people village in center-south Italy. If the Internet didn't exist the only thing I could have done was probably to be a farmer and sell harvests on local markets, speaking italian dialect with no clue about how the world works.
Now I do speak and understand English. I am a computer Scientist and software engineer. I studied physics and I am aware that the life we live today is not magic. The way we control information and excite electromagnetic fields and build on top of that protocols and abstractions and digital circuits and compilers and operating systems and browsers and media and content it just a marvellous engineering effort by the most awesome species ever existed in the universe as far as I know.
I am so grateful for being born in the 21st century and have the possibility to learn so much from some of the smartest and thoughtful people in the world.
Thanks Elon, thanks Lex."
128,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","I give Elon credit. I do like that he can quote out of pocket things you'd never expect. 

I enjoy having knowledge someone else doesn't have, and being able to give information on the spot people didn't think I'd know.

It must be a good feeling for Elon given he knows quite a lot. He knows a lot more than me that's for sure, but I'll steadily learn and even if I never go as far in life as he did. I can still learn, and share."
129,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Holy shit, imagine getting 2 and half hours of one of the busiest man on the planet for your podcast, man. Respect, you totally deserve it!"
130,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","A short summary:

- Finishing high stress situations sucessfully you feel more relief than elation
- Most difficult problem regarding starship is engine production, right from the materials to design you have to have the best of everything to make the best engine
- Mindset of Elon: When something is important enough, you have to get it done. there’s no factor of motivation or anything in order to work on something
- Thinking in terms of first principles can be applied to any walk of life, just have an axiomatic base that you believe in and then you reason up from there to cross check your conclusion with the axiomatic truth.
- Another mental model of thinking is to take a thing and scale it to a very large or a very small number and see how do things change ( you can use it to scale a product large and see if its still expensive by which you can arrive at an conclusion to work on the design of the product or not)
- it's important to think of these things like probabilities, not certainties, there's a probability that something bad will happen on earth. Hence, its best that we work towards making life a multi planetary species
- Probably in mars, direct democracy over representational democracy works best!
- Helpful to think money in terms of information theory, with fiat currency the error in the database keeps increasing as government tries to print more money, cryptocurrency is an attempt to reduce this error created by the government.
- Bitcoin is useful as a store of wealth but not as a day to day currency. Dogecoin could be used as a day to day currency as a fixed number of hash string gets generated every year and inflation reduces over time.
- It is possible that satoshi nakamoto is Nick Szabo
- Replacing processed images by raw photon inputs from camera and switching more traditional code over the neural network (as it does seem have to hit its global maximum on vector space creation)
- Lot of bare-metal coding C/C++ is  required for tesla self driving traditonally more on the control part after input has processed
- Human robots are a thing, might replace manual un-interesting work.
- History is a good way to learn and understand about the nature of civilization and indiviuals
- Advice to young people: Try to be useful, ask youself are you contributing more than you consume? To have a net positive contribution to the society would be the right thing to aim for.
- Reading a condensed version of the Britannica encyclopedia can be useful. Just read,read as much as you can.
- Having a growth of the pie mindset, over thinking in terms of zero-sum game is useful. Usually many people think in terms of zero sum game, but that is rarely the case as the pie gets bigger as more people get involved
- Whats the meaning of life? The answer is the universe, now its just a matter of asking the right questions. Elons foundation of philosophy is that he is curious about the nature of the universe. But we will not live forever, hence expanding the scope and scale of consciousness is fundamentally a good thing."

Our 3.5 y.o old has fallen asleep, and we can enjoy the episode together! Such a great holiday treat!
Oh, and Elon’s pauses make us think whether sth is bad with our Internet connection, or he’s taking time to think. Apparently, the latter 😄 I wish I could learn how not to be afraid taking long pauses during the interviews and meetings😃"
157,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252",The difference in how he handles these interviews is a completely different level than his first one on JRE. Glad to see the growth.

189,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Elon mentionning the fuel problems the German had during WW2 reminded me that the Nazis putting their hands on all the fuel they could find in occupy France was one of the reason for french engineer Louis Breguet to create an electric car back in 1941. My grand father had one, I remember seeing it as a kid. I think a few hundred models only were produced. It could go around 50km/hour and travel 100km distance on a charge, and I think it took 24 hours to recharge the battery... no Tesla super charger back then. LOL"

There is so much to do in this world. And the pie has grown dramatically as Elon rightly puts it.
199,DxREm3s1scA,"Elon Musk: SpaceX, Mars, Tesla Autopilot, Self-Driving, Robotics, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #252","Believe it or not, the standard for laws written in the early days of our nation is that laws had to be in  plain English.  Still required today but everyone ignores it.  The concept of constraining the Federal Government was the House (elected by the people directly) and the Senate (elected by the states), between the people and the states could regulate the Federal Government.  Plus the fact that the states funded the Federal Government, if the states did not like the direction of the Federal Government, they could withhold funding.  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created a fiat central bank, IRS and bypassed the states and taxed the citizens directly, the constitutionality of all three is murky at best."

244,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Wow! Those movements are becoming very smooth! Tesla is on point with these robot developments!
245,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Love the way these robots walk. Reminds me of my younger days when I was severely constipated.
246,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,1:42 classic tesla disco party
247,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,can't wait to go clubbing with robots
248,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Meanwhile Atlas spider crawls across the celling looking for optimal takedown angle to rip off this things head.
249,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I’m 67 yrs of age with arthritis & other health problems, however as I look into my future with my husband being of the same age, I can see great use for the future Optimus robot. There is much I could teach Optimus from general household tasks to shopping, helping my granddaughter with school work, playing with the dog to learning gardening, food growing etc. I’m sure many people would find Optimus extremely useful particularly if one has disabilities. In addition it would provide conversation & help prevent loneliness. So Mr Musk should you need an Australian to help integrate Optimus into a family household that most certainly will in the future require more help I am more than happy to assist. Regardless, when you are ready to sell to the public I would definitely be excited to purchase an Optimus as I see these robots being essential for continuing life within the home as people age. Love watching these videos and seeing Tesla’s progression in this exciting and extraordinary field. ❤"
250,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Detroit Become Human plot is getting closer to be a non-fictional story
251,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This new version looks really cool. I love how they styled it. They are making fast progress.
252,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,That walk is me at 2AM trying not to wake anyone up as I get water
253,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This is game changing I cannot wait to see what next year's progress brings
254,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This is what Trunks warned us about
255,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I feel like this technology could eventually be used to develop crazy functional prosthesis
256,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Incredible progress in such a short period of time. This is in the unprecedented levels of improvements of any tech product I've ever seen. The engineering that went into those 11 Dof hands alone, very cool"
257,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,At least the terminator doesn't walk very fast yet lol
258,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The dance scene at the end 😂😂😂
259,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Now just imagine where we will be in 10 years if progress like this keeps up, or even accelerates."
260,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Wow, it's quite amazing to see how quick it's evolving. Well done! Huge achievement"
261,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I wanted to be a software engineer since I was 8 years old so I could recreate Commander Data from Star Trek. That was 30 years ago, and now I work on AI. For most my life, I didn't think I would live to see anything close to AGI or this level of robotics. This video brought me to tears. Well done Optimus team."
262,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I never expected this from a company that sells cars
263,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Okay, now we got smooth hand movements the only thing we need now is the smooth leg movements like Petman and Spot from Boston Dyamics"
264,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The fluidity of its motion is insane
265,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"The progress in this short period of time is amazing. The movement of the hands and arms is really natural! I think that next year it will walk ""normally"""
266,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"“I… am Optimus Prime, leader of the autobots.”"
267,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The fact the first version of Optimus is named bumblebee lol
268,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The fact that it took so little time for them to get this far is amazing
269,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Pretty amazing progress. The fingers articulation is just phenomenal for only barely a year of work. That tactile sensing on the fingers are so cool too! Cant wait till the day it gets so affordable, anyone can have one in their home."
270,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,welcome to the beginning of the end
271,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I mean you just gotta respect the engineering of this thing. Simply amazing. Tesla continues to innovate.
272,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Absolutely amazing work! The secret of the cheetah's speed is flexible back. So I think if you add spine mobility, walking speed and balance will become easier and faster. I mean, it's unlikely that you will be able to run like an Olympic champion with a stick tied to your back. You can just try it)... I know that designing is incredibly hard work so it is just an idea to help Optimus run into the future like Hermes. Cheers!"
273,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The movement especially the fingers are so smooth.. can’t imagine what it’s gonna be like in another year!
274,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,So this is the robot that's gonna steal my janitorial job
275,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,the ending got me. I want to party with a robot.
276,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I heard Amazon is also going to be releasing one of these, too. It will be called the Optimus Prime."
277,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I'm almost convinced that Optimus is mocap controlled, I don't see how else you'd make all those fingers work"
278,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,and this is how Mitchell’s vs machines comes to life.
279,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This is so cool! Yay for rapid development! Keep it up tesla!
280,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Insane advancement!!!! Just imagine the incredible doors these robots are opening for the future
281,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,It’ll never not amaze me how amazing it is that we can walk how we can and robots show us just how hard it actually is to walk upright on two legs.
282,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,This is way better than Boston Dynamics. Aside from the part that this robot moves around like it took a crap in it’s pants.
283,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I am impressed that they kept the weight down to 121 lbs.   I am guessing that the power/weight ratio will depend on the task these machines are designed to perform.
284,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I think Optimus is almost ready for daily tasks like to load a dishwasher/washing machine, unload them, fold clothes/sheets and clean the house. It just need to go up and down stairs and that's it. That's more than enough to have a SOLID product. 

That hand and finger movements are incredible, in less than 10 years it will be able to cook and wash dishes by hand. No need for jumps and acrobatics like Boston Dynamics, it needs to handle daily tasks first."
285,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,I remember when it was first introduced. It looked like a bot from the 90s lol. The progress they've made is remarkable.
286,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Nah. IRL Mann vs Machine before GTA 6 is wild
287,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"To be honest, im just waiting for these robots to take over the world ngl"
288,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"I am very impressed, especially by the very human like movements. The combination of mechanics, electronics and software is pretty remarkable. I am sure this will change the world forever! We should see it as an opportunity, not as a threat 🙏🏻"
289,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Wow this is amazing! Imagine how advanced humanoid robots are going to be in 2030s.
290,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Hand movements look epic
291,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Tesla team is amazing!!! Well done, you are truly designing the future of humanity!"
292,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"To me robots like these remind me of how incredible humans are. The way we are able to walk, to use our hands and fingers is just insane when you see how freaking hard it is to replicate that. We are, to this day, not able to recreate a human body with all its abillities to even come close to the ""original"". it's absolutely stunning. compared to a real human even the most advanced robots look like toys for adults even tho they are serious tech. gotta love nature!"
293,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,The Robot Era is here. iRobot called it
294,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Imagine if Optimus is capable of operating in a Tesla service center?
295,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"Knowing Elon and the Teslabot team, this is remarkable in itself but they've got so much more already up their sleeve, ideas, concepts and new activities. The forefront of robotics and ai innovation is right here."
296,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,i cant even imagine how advanced the final product will be
297,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,"While Optimus here is walking like it shit it’s pants, Boston Dynamics has robots doing fucking Kung Fu and Jackie Chan stunts."
298,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,Amazing the progress that is made with Optimus - Gen 2!
299,cpraXaw7dyc,Optimus - Gen 2 | Tesla,日本から応援してます。電気自動車だけでなくロボット技術すら日本をもうすぐ超える

476,XiQkeWOFwmk,Tesla Bot Update,"Wrt to walking speed, it looks like they were taking 35-40 cm steps at a rate of about 1 step per second. So that gives a walking speed of about 1.2-1.5 km/h. That is about 1/4 of their intended top speed of about 6 km/h. 

Wrt to walking technique, they are walking more upright now - straightening much more at the knee - than the ones shown in March at Investor Day. That means they must have improved their sense of balance while walking. They still need to improve further on this and then get the heel-to-toe landing of the foot with the 'toe-off' motion as they take each new step. Hopefully, that will be achieved over the next few months."

While travelling in the direct sunlight during sunset time, the warning appeared; ""Take Control Immediately""  The camera only based FSD system could not function due to direct sunlight and asked me (the human driver) to take control immediately.  So, if a Robotaxi has no steering wheel and it is facing the direct sunlight, how can Tesla ensure that the camera based FSD system can still work flawlessly?  It only takes a couple of high profile crashes with fatalities to ban Tesla from Robotaxi service and loss of trust by the public about Tesla's camera based FSD system."

583,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,16:12 The placement of the cooling fan is absolutely hilarious 🤣
584,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,While not having a side view mirror is understandable as it's self-driving. But I think it would be quite important to know if there were any incoming trafic while coming out of the car if it drops you off on the side of the road.
585,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,Totally no details about the mileage and everything else that is vital as a FSD vehicle. No wonder Tesla's share price drops immediately after this event 💀
586,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,I love this channel always non-bias and always thinking outside the box and not following the media hype
587,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"All things to ensure people buy more:
No manual fast charging
Slow charging
Only 2 seats

More cars on the road is not a good thing"
588,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"Man, this Robotaxi really captures the vibe of playing on low graphics settings"
589,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,Marques shaving his head on camera... The Tesla engineers are gonna start working nights to get these things out.
590,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,First time I've seen your channel. Great clear presentation
591,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"This is gonna revolutionalize the way we travel,  Like the RGB death tunnel did in Vegas...🙃"
592,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,The event feels like the presentation you get for a Ponzi scheme.
593,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"At the event, Scott Walter and I were discussing whether it was AI or a person remote controlling the bot. I listened to 3 bots with 3 different voices, so I was convinced it is a person. Someone asked it point-blank, and it replied, ""I am currently assisted by a human"". Another spoke to it in German, and it had no idea what she was saying.
Net: It was human assisted.
To be fair, the initial roll out of Optimus is for industrial use, not serving drinks, so it would be a waste of resources to do millions of $ worth of training for such an event.
The take-away is the robot hardware design is capable of great dexterity and precision. These are the skills an industrial robot would need."
594,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,The Robot Taxis look like my car drawings back when i was 5
595,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"Funny how the ""world we want"" images weren't of robots or self driving cars, they were of cities with parks and without miles of parking lots everywhere"
596,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,A friend who does chores for you.  What a time to be alive.
597,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,Maybe the Optimus robot is a clue to how they will get self driving to work ... they'll have employees remotely driving the car for you.
598,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"The fact that the robots were so clearly at _least_ using a human for talking (and let's be real, probably other things), it makes me wonder if the ""robo"" taxis were being remote controlled as well, and that's why they were comfortable allowing them to operate around so many people."
599,fgm5uZaS3-E,The Tesla Robotaxi is Confusing...,"So basically Elon presented:
- The same concept of an autopilot as presented a few years ago (2016?)
- 2 New car concepts making as much sense as the Cybertruck that are probably release as quick as the roadster
- The same AI claims as 3(?) years ago
- Showed of their robotocis (maybe the only + on this list)

Am I missing something?"

For me, plants are one of the things that give me joy. You can find meaning in the mundane. Those are the things that make us who we are, give us appreciation for things in life and can even provide purpose. I fear that we are moving ahead too much. All these excessive advances in technology is also causing our society to forget how to interact with one another. It honestly goes so much deeper than interaction with others and, dare I say, allows us to no longer know who WE are, what we like, and who we become. YIKES."

FSD right now is a 95% solution - which is impressive - but short of the 10 years worth of hype and promises.  What's crazy is that us early adopters, who bought into the hype and paid 10K or more for functionality that's 'coming soon', are now hearing that we'll need buy a new car with upgraded hardware to get full functionality!  The icing on the cake:  Unless you hit a special promotion - we will also have to pay another 10K for the FSD software when you buy that new car.

*think about this.*
A) Atlas is very good at calculating balance correction.  If you push it, it will autocorrect.
B) Now say you fall into atlas accidentally because YOU tripped.  Atlas now autocorrects its balance and crushes your limb in the process because it valued its balance over a much MUCH harder calculation including your choice of balancing and autocorrection in real time.
C) everything in (b) gets multiplied even further into complexity as people have entirely different levels of coordination, or accident experience.
D) it chooses a neutral option, of collapse, and now a dangerous heavy piece of machinery with limbs is falling with/on you.

Improve flexibility, limb length and balance becomes more difficult (especially for things like backflips) because centre of gravity is higher and with a higher centre of gravity comes higher angular momentum, slower rotary response and higher angular commitment; pretty much all the things which force taller people to go about balance-dependent actions more slowly, on average."

832,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Really liked how you structured the video with the questions. Great job!
833,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Cleo, you're so amazing, so glad you got to go to Boston Dymanics. I reached out to my aunt who works there, so I hope she somehow helped, she's a big fan as well!"
834,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"It’s crazy that people will watch something like “The Terminator”, and then come here and see nothing wrong with this."
835,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Amazing Cleo! I must have seen over 50 atlas videos over the years but yours gave loads of great info and context that wern’t in any of the otherones!
836,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"I appreciate you pointing out that humanoid robots are necessary in spaces built for humans. I think that for places where robots do the primary work, those spaces should be built for robots, and humans can adapt to those spaces when necessary (we're good at that)."
837,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Why does the worker look like Vsauce💀
838,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"There is this movie in my country. Its called Robot (that's the translation) and its my favorite movie ever. In it the scientist creates an andro-humanoid robot, so basically it exactly looks like a man but it can do what what humans can't like walk into a burning building and all that stuff. The thing is it learns human commands as it spends more time with us. Like it gets a command ""go put the TV"" (translated into english it sounds weird but thats exactly what we say) and people know that means ""Turn the TV on"" but the robot just takes the TV off the wall and puts it on the ground, well, he drops it. 
But it learns. And later in the movie it is asked to save people in burning building. The problem is it saves a girl who is completely naked cause she was in the shower when the fire started and brings her to the public where there are TV reporters and many people. It doesn't understand what the problem is. And the scientist realizes humans can't keep telling it everything right and wrong. 
To combat this, the scientist gives the robot feelings and (somehow) programs it to feel emotions. It seems like it doesn't work tho and the scientist gets mad at the robot, but surprisingly the robot gets mad at the scientist too. Eventually this feelings thing gets out of control and stuff happens. 
Its a dope movie and seeing atlas and these almost human like robots reminded me of this movie."
839,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"3:44 Hey Vsauce, Michael here"
840,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"""do _you_ still feel like this when you stand next to atlas?""
""every day. every day, i love this robot.""
humans' drive and passion to learn and create and connect with their creations will never not be special to me."
841,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"As beautiful and elegant the atlas robot is, it's also scaring and intemidating knowing the extent of impact it will have on us."
842,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"8:40 sorry isn't gonna work Cleo , you are on his hitlist now 🤣 the day he learn to run faster , he will come for his revenge"
843,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"There's an idea that humanoid robots might be necessary in order for self improving AI to become a reality as having a body that is similar to our own gives it insight into the material world of things and actions that would be necessary for it to understand the world it is to be a part of created by us with actions out of things.

The ""don't step on the dog"" thing for example. A non embodied AI could see a static 3d scan of the room and decide that the dog is a good stepping stool. A non AI humanoid robot would not know that the dog is there because it wasn't preprogrammed with it. But a humanoid AI robot would recognize that it is moving in real time and could test that it is soft and thus probably not a good stepping stool apart from the negative feedback from the owner when attempting to do so. It could therefore avoid the mistake right on the first try."
844,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Actually, the robots that take over should thank you for testing their ability to not fall over; making sure it works."
845,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"That last part about military robots, it seems almost inevitable that this will happen. How is a tank with a targeting computer any different than a robot? How much computer assistance does it take until something is considered ""AI""? This will almost certainly happen without people even realizing it like a frog in hot water."
846,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"8:44 was just gold!!! 
Your videos are amazing and highly educational and humorous at the same time. Please never stop this!!!"
847,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,I am extremely excited for a humanoid robot with general AI. I am honestly not scared of it at all.
848,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,First time I have seen a Boston Dynamics video that wasn't terrifying. Thanks!
849,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"9:03 - I think the biggest difference there is that Atlas is purely reactive while you are very clearly bracing for what you know is coming, the second you perceive that its about to come you start tilting forward to compensate. The real experience here would probably be to do this blindfolded"
850,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Absolutely quality video really accessible for those of us who aren't scientists 😁👍🏻 Great Job, Thank You."
851,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Now imagine military robots that move so fast, you need a strobe light to see them. Scary stuff."
852,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"""Human bodies are so amazing"" SHOWS SIMONE BILES. Gosh darn, I'm not like that"
853,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"An interesting side topic to this video is the idea of the uncanny valley, essentially when artificially made human faces (digital or in real life) creep us out because we can tell they don't look or move correctly. Curious how the development of humanoid robots in the future will incorporate that idea, and whether we will move more toward robots with intentionally non-human facial features, or if we will see more trying to perfect the the human face and its emotions. Would love to see a video or short from you on this topic! Thanks for making such great content!"
854,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Putting Tesla in the same conversation with Boston Dynamics is pretty funny. Tesla is playing with crayons while Boston Dynamics is making masterpieces.
855,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Opinion: There is about 4 minutes of useful information in this entire presentation. Also, for humanoid robots, I wouldn't trust Tesla hype at all for now."
856,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Thank you, Cleo, for giving us this look into such a magnificent machine, and the people that made it possible. I love segments like this because it really demonstrates how wonderfully ingenious humanity is."
857,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Most excellent presentation. It is interesting that although Atlas does not learn from watching people, you were able to instantly learn to duplicate its dance moves, just from watching. It will be interesting, to say the least, to watch the truly evolutionary processes that are about to explode on us."
858,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Loved the reference to putting the groceries 'away', as in 'away in the cupboard' not 'away out the window'. Laughed so hard. Thanks for being a bright spark!"
859,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"12:10 So Atlas isn't learning to hate me, whew."
860,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"I LOVE ""ad"" sign. So respectful!"
861,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"I suppose the only weakness robots have is in the joints which have to put up with very high torques, I remember this robotic spider a few years ago, and the guy said if you accidentaly move it the gears will strip."
862,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"As impressive as this robots are, its even more impressive that someone like Isaac Asimov could predict this future, so many decades ago. I guess that when she proposed the need to let the robot know that putting the groceries away without stepping on the dog, also indicates the need of Asimov’s three laws of robotics. Can’t wait to have my own robot assistant! I’m tired of putting away groceries hehe 😂"
863,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"what an outstanding video, clear, concise, easy to understand while still light and interesting. Well done!"
864,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Cleo’s videos are real masterpieces
865,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,I kind of want a whole video just about how we are keeping from weaponizing them. They can be weaponized even without a gun or anything that’s a weapon. They can certainly use  any tools as weapons.

867,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,I think what blows my mind interacting with gpts and robot is that no matter how much I understand these are just computers. It’s hard not to have an emotional attachment EVEN when they are not trying just because they ACT human.
868,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,I dont know why but this episode felt like claire dynphy's character from modern family learning about robots. Great work btw.

871,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Hey Cleo, great video as always. I just one suggestion - would it possible for you to create a 'More' Cleo Abram channel where you can post a long form version video of the main channel video. This is in no way to belittle the amount of effort you put into the videos you put on here ( it's truly incredible and evident ). However, I did feel like you had to condense down a huge topic to fit the time frame. Personally, I love long form videos and I think if you could post a longer version, that would allow for much more breathing room for such a vast topic. Keep em coming <3"
872,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"This lady should be an actor, she’s great."
873,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,What I love about this is that you don't consider your audience dumb. Most YouTubers would have asked stupid question or made silly unfunny overenthusiastic gag reels.
874,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Thanks Cleo.  Another fantastic video!

WIth every push, I was worried it was going to come back at you ta boot, so... so glad it ended when it did. Also, and can't stress this enough, thank you for taking the pushes yourself in front of atlas.. if there is a digital reckoning and all, at least you can say, I was willing , and I did, take the same pushes... Wasn't just picking on atlas. Great video! Loved seeing inside Boston Dynamics ;)"
879,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Great video Cleo! Fantastic to see how humanoid robots are developing. Can't wait for your video with Spot!
880,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Cute video Cleo, really happy that Boston Dynamics excepted your visit. What I am waiting for is for a technology to exist, to allow actuators to become more muscle-like and organic which will allow a robot to move fluidly and human-like vs mechanical. Hence, I do know of a private company that is working on this. Salute!"
881,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Obviously you are extremely intelligent and well learned, but you've done everything in your power to make the principles and the world of robotics accessible to everyone,

Thanks Cleo"
882,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"The tail question was a really good one. I wondered why not let the robot have 4 legs, wouldn't that help it balance better? I do hope that in future this will be something that companies think deeper about what can be done with a 4 legged robot"
883,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Love your content. Wish more of the internet had this level of quality ❤
884,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,It's been a while since I've checked in on the progress of humanoid robots. This video was an excellent walkthrough! Atlas is much smarter than I thought!
885,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"Atlas is smarter than I thought!
Specifically 10:12, I thought it was doing exactly what was shown at 10:17.

My background: We did, in pairs, some tower from blocks building with the Pepper robot at uni, pretty cool. The Pepper would shut off because you kept its arm extended forward for too long between tests, overheating the motors. Such little annoyances taking up so much time! I would do it again now, with more experience :)"
886,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,We're gonna see a Horizon Zero Dawn in real life one day
887,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,This show is way better than what CBS did on their coverage on Atlas. Kudos!
888,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"This looks like it was really fun. Thank you for asking  ""why"" they have human-like form. At least Atlas doesn't have a fake human face or look like it's wearing a bra."
889,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"The history of Boston Dynamics, the reason they are even a company today, is because they were a defense contractor. They seem to ignore that past. They did amazing things with DoD money and they shouldn't shy away from it."
890,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Cleo might have the best youtube playlist ever
891,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,I am glad BD allowed you to interact with Atlas. I've not seen any videos with outsiders and Atlas together which makes me kinda skeptical about it.
892,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,Good stuff! Great take on it. Always love your videos and the perspective you share.
893,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"now that we have robots that can see their environment fairly well ,and have generative AI i wonder if the issues with getting something like Atlas to sit will be easier to teach it? Like using the AI and it's vision to watch how humans sit on different seats or structures? I'm glad I'm still fairly young (36) and hopefully will live to see robots living with us like Fallout or something (my favorite video game series of all time :) ). I know people probably say this to Cleo all the time, but there is something so attractive about someone who has the kind of personality she does. Smart, curious ready to learn and super friendly being pretty doesn't hurt either. I saw that to say , it's the perfect kind of person imo to get people interested in stuff that a lot of people used to consider ""nerdy"" or ""geeky"". Fairly new to the channel just wanted to say thanks for all the excellent content i've seen so far and i wish you the best of luck and can't wait to see more in the future.

I'm writing this after i watched more  of the video  and saw they actually talked about this  , so cool @ 12:20."
894,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,That’s awesome. I’d love to get to meet a robot like that and play with it
895,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"I totally believe Cleo could and should learn to do a backflip, for the content of course.  There are many online tutorials but I am sure with some connections a good trainer could be found and in one or two days it would happen."
896,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"I used to do armed European martial arts - mostly longsword, back sword, and dagger, but sometimes we'd experiment with more niche things like pikes.  Who knew that would be useful in robotics experiments?  Watching you try to push Atlas, I kept thinking ""just take a step and get your hips in it!"""
897,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,I always thought this robot was cgi whenever I came across clips of it online 😯Atlas is so smooth my god
898,nAgTgwak7ME,I Challenged Boston Dynamics&#39; Famous Atlas Robot,"There's no way these companies would willingly keep preventing weaponization of robots or enabling/providing knowledge to weaponize robots. Companies like Raytheon are pretty much in a marriage with governments and it does not matter which party the president and his/her cabinet would be from. They are most certainly keeping a watchful eye at these developments for now, when the time and technology is right, they will most certainly swoop in."
